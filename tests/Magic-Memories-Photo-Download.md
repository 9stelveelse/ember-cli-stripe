As a result, ensuring that she eats the proper food is necessary and her diet is extremely restricted. She has also suffered from seizures for many years, and due to her disorder, she has experienced other developmental delays.

At F1.4, the resulting shots are always focused right on the eyes with beautiful falloff everywhere else. This is especially amazing with kids with Down syndrome (see above) since a lot of them have little white starbursts in their eyes.
 
This perfect angel has Down syndrome. She is also one the the unlucky kids to have had leukemia, BUT in an odd twist, most of the kids that get that leukemia and also have Down syndrome are more likely to survive than the kids without Down syndrome. She is a very, very active kid and has a great sense of humor, so I just let her go.
 
I used the 105mmm lens for this session because I wanted nice bokeh in the trees to keep it from being too busy, but I also wanted to be able to give her space to just run without me having to be right on top of her. As the sun set that evening, I told her to run up towards the top of the hill and then stop and twirl in her dress.
 
This little pixie has neurofibromatosis. It is a genetic disorder that causes tumors to form on nerve tissue. These tumors can develop anywhere in the nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord and nerves. In addition to this, she is dyslexic. At eight years old when these photos were taken, she had JUST learned how to read. This has caused a lot of problems at school with delayed learning, but also bullying.

Another example of magical backlighting. I know that this lens is stunning with the sun directly behind the subject, so I placed her right in the middle of a sunbeam. I wanted it to light up her hair and wings, but not blow out her white dress, so I made sure I had backed up far enough to get her at just the front edge of it.
 
I wanted to focus on her face but let the rest of the photo fade out a little. So I put her into the grape vines a little to frame her in the photo, then used my 105mm to make sure she was in focus at F1.4, but that the rest of the image was soft and dreamy.
 
This sweetheart has autism. She is also very hard of hearing, which makes photography for her very challenging. I actually had to wear a device that amplified my voice and transmitted it to her hearing aids.
 
I actually took this image before I owned the 105 mm, and I wish I had been able to get closer at the time, because of her near deafness. Despite wearing the transmitter device, I think I might have been out of range, or we ran out of batteries or something, because I practically had to yell at her from this distance. But, it all worked out and we were happily singing a song together for this image.
 
This image was the last shot of the night, and I wanted to create something sparkly. There was a tree decorated with fairy lights on it, so I put her in front of it and picked up the 135mm to make the background sparkles turn into fuzzier bokeh. Since she has zero mental considerations to think about, this session was treated as a regular portrait session.
 
This sweetie has a rare, severe cardiac condition called Pulmonary Vein Stenosis. Her particular kind is called Congenital Pulmonary Vein Stenosis, meaning she was born with it. It has an 80% mortality rate. She had open heart surgery at three months old and over 10 heart catheterizations. There is no cure for this condition. Oftentimes it leads to a double lung transplant. In addition, she has a duplication of a portion of her Chromosome 2. This leads to further delays in physical development, as well as speech. She is non-verbal and on oxygen 24/7.
 
The two things she asked from me were a rainbow dress and a unicorn. The unicorn I knew I could get, but the rainbow dress I had to borrow from another photographer friend! This was taken in October when the light was beginning to get a bit strong, so I picked the 135mm lens for this shot to make sure I got the least amount of specular highlights on the leaves as I could. The light is nice and golden but still blurry thanks to the lens and the compression it provides.
 
An overhead shot of a full body is impossible with a telephoto lens, and this image is definitely an example of that. With a 45mm focal length, I was able to stand on a short ladder with her on the ground and get the full tail in the photo.
 
I picked a 50mm macro lens for her because I wanted to be close to her and make her feel larger than life, and I wanted to make sure her eyes were sharp and engaged. The lens distortion from being so close makes her look even more like a pixie and draws all the attention of the viewer right to her sparkling eyes.
 
This little girl has a rare chromosomal deletion, 13q 13.2-14.11. It has manifested in many ways for her: Microcephally (small head), scoliosis, seizures, hypotonic cerebral palsy (which means low muscle tone), a poor immune system, severe eczema, allergies, she is legally blind, Guillian-Barre syndrome, a severe sensory integration disorder, and moderate to severe hearing loss.
 
Since this sweetie is non-verbal and has a hard time hearing or seeing, I knew that in order to get the best interaction and expressions, I needed to be pretty close to her. I picked the 50mm macro lens for most of the session so I could stay close and be sure to catch her zipping around in her wheelchair. The biggest smile I got was right after I jumped out of the way to keep her from running me over. She thought my yelp was pretty funny, and she was a terror in that chair.

Sasha, Heather here! For me, the project really began to take off in the community when I had a story run by the local newspaper on the event. I contacted them and asked for someone in community stories and asked for a press release, they opted to make it a bigger story. I also make sure to run the event at the same time every year so people know when to expect it as well. Good luck!
 
When I had a chance to work with Magic Memories, I figured it was the perfect time to test the waters of another company with little monetary risk. I was pleasantly surprised to find that not only do they have high-quality, reasonably-priced photo books, they also have lots of other fun gift ideas.
 
Hi! I'm Jennifer. I'm perpetually waiting for the next thing, living for the big moments, and longing to explore anywhere to which I can escape. 

 *But life's too short for that.* 

 We are working on finding joy in the everyday moments, delight in just being with those we love, and magic in the smallest things. 
 Stick around for conversations about family travel (often to Disney Destinations) and how to create magical memories at home. 

 **I'm so glad you're here.**
 
Let our team of skilled photographers capture your visit with us at the Polynesian Cultural Center, and make them lasting memories! Take home with you a collection of photographs that will be cherished for years to come.
 
I assure you that you will be able to enjoy the performance even though you might not understand a word of Spanish, which is Spanish of the 18th century anyway, and I would like you to consider the situation and cultural context this performance took place. If you try to understand why certain things are done the way they are done, you will gain a better understanding of magic, I promise.
 
First of all I should say that this is already the tenth year in a row they book me for that event, interrupted by three Covid Years, and always in combination with two or three other magic colleagues.
 
Second, the hotel, which boasts a spa with swimming pool, sauna, etc. , offers full meals, one of the best breakfast buffets I know (and believe me I know A LOT), with exclusive regional specialties, virtually all made by hand, including half a dozen breads, salads, sausages, home-made jams, juices, and a large etcetera.
 
What is absolutely fantastic about it is that unlike what sounds like the food offer of a luxury ocean liner, this is all in small portions, so that you do not gain weight even by a gram, not even I do!
 
Third, the attendance is limited to about twenty people. This year, due to the European Soccer Championship and other conflicting activities, we had only thirteen participants, which we split into two groups.
 
The second artist this year was Kai Borchers, Kalibo, a street performer with lots of experience working in other venues, too, such as cruise ships, and whom I had never heard of before, but who very pleasantly surprised me with his human qualities and his artistic competence.
 
This year I asked Pit and Kai if they wanted to join in, and what a good idea this was, as Pit started out with a twenty minute card act that floored everyone present, at the same entertaining them royally. This blog is too short to tell you about the effects he did, but believe me, they were all outstanding.
 
Thursday and Friday mornings started at 10:30 with each participant taking a 40-minute private class with one of us instructors. This is a very successful unit I introduced last year, where each participant can ask any type of question, discuss a problem, get a personal coaching. etc.
