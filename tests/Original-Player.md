I've been using the Jones Original for the past two seasons. I've also owned the Player's bag. My biggest complaint with the Player's series is that it's a structured bag -- that is, it has two thin rods running along each side to add rigidity. I found little advantage to having that rigidity and the rod added carry discomfort, so I removed the rods.
 
I prefer the single divider of the Players. The original two divider gives me binding issues at times when I carry the full quiver of stix. I appreciate the metal structure as well. Keeps it from completely sagging and never bothered me when walking.

I have both and really like both, but the players series bag is better (IMO) because it has a spine. Although I carry trestle sticks with my bags, very frequently while waiting for others on the fairway to hit I like to stand the bag directly upright and just lean my arm against the clubs (driver). The original doesn't have a spine, so as soon as I stand it up upright, the bag itself will start sagging downward, and I have to "reach" lower to get the bag on my shoulder again when my playing partners have hit.
 
The Players looks a little better IMO, but the original would be my choice... I think the opening in the original is a smidge bigger, not by much but every little bit helps with the jones bags. Cool bags but I went back to a traditional stand bag.
 
I do the same... I have a long water bottle and it sits in the pocket beside the ball pocket really well. I should try the ball pocket itself without balls in.. could most likely keep it open a tad for easy in/out and not worry about the bottle falling out.
 
I purchased a Players Bag. I've not used it but a few times. While I actually like the single support rod and the ergonomics, my main complaint is that it is just too long. A 34 inch putter falls into the bag. I'd pick up an Original if doing it again.
 
What won me over was that i wasnt in love with the single divider on the Players. Otherwise, i probably would have gone that route. Still very much happy with the Original though, wouldnt change my mind given a do-over.

I can relate as I also went back / forth before purchasing. I liked the appearance of the Players slightly more, but wasn't crazy about the single divider, and the deciding factor was the larger pocket for rain gear that put the Original out front. Still pleased with my choice.
 
I posted on this a while ago when I got the Original... It was cool, but I didn't love it. I thought the 3 way divider was superior to the 2 way on the Players... I can officially say now that I was wrong. There is virtually NO tangle on the Players and having the spine in the bag is really nice vs. the Original. Between these two bags, I am choosing the players everytime, especially in the Heather colorways.
 
I think both are pretty minimalist if you want them to be. Both are pretty simple and have 3 pockets, but the unstructured nature of the Original would probably give that old school minimalist vibe a little bit more. For me I prefer the Players as I like the 2 way divider instead of 3. As stated above a 3 way divided for a top this size just feels too cluttered for me, and 2 is just right. I'd even be fine with no divider.
 
**Position:** Midfielder **Clubs:** RGN (all seasons) The 2021 league MVP is one of just six players who've been with the same club for every season of NWSL. The Welsh international helped the Reign to two NWSL Shields (2014, 2015) and five playoff appearances. She started an incredible 125 consecutive regular-season games, a feat no other NWSL field player has matched.
 
**Position:** Midfielder **Clubs:** WAS (all seasons) Huster is the only remaining member of the Spirit's original 2013 roster. The midfielder has led Washington to four playoff appearances, including the 2016 final where the club fell on penalties, and then last fall's championship that saw the Spirit triumph 2-1 over Chicago for their first NWSL trophy.
 
**Position:** Midfielder **Clubs:** CHI (all seasons) No one has played more games in a Chicago uniform than Mautz, whose Red Stars career predates the launch of NWSL. The striker has seen the club set a league record for consecutive playoff appearances and reach three finals in three years. She is the only player remaining from Chicago's inaugural NWSL squad.
 
Watch Video >\*\* McDonald one of just four players to score more than 50 regular-season goals and is also the all-time regular-season assists leader (27). She was named MVP of the 2018 NWSL championship game after scoring a brace to help North Carolina win 3-0 at Portland to claim the club's first NWSL title. McDonald has played for more clubs than any other player, and has scored for all but one of them.
 
Watch Video >\*\* Pressley recently played her 100th regular-season NWSL game and also converted her first league PK. The veteran defender led the Spirit to its first playoff appearance in 2014 and helped the Dash to its best defensive season before joining the Pride. Pressley assisted Orlando's first playoff goal in 2017.
 
**Position:** Forward **Clubs:** RGN (all seasons) Rapinoe leads the Reign in career goals, both for the regular-season and the playoffs. She's started every playoff game in club history and is one of three players who've spent every NWSL season with the Seattle club. One of the top penalty-takers in the league, she scored the 100th NWSL goal from the spot in 2017.
 
**Position:** Forward **Clubs:** POR (all seasons) No Thorns player has scored more goals or played more minutes than Sinclair. Scoring in the very first league game, she's spent every season of NWSL with Portland, leading the club to two NWSL championship titles, two NWSL Shields, the 2021 Challenge Cup championship plus the 2020 Fall Series title. She's one of just two players to score in every season.
 
I usually use vlc media player for my movies but my little cousin has somehow messed all the settings up and now when I try to play a movie, I can't watch it properly. The player still works but its like all the settings like the colours and saturation and the settings that make the picture ok are messed up and I don't know how to put them back to normal.

Im trying to play an animation when a character overalps with a mesh. The animation plays but how do I revert the character back to its original animation. I want the animation to be a knock out so when the character get hit it cant move for a while, but then goes back to its original animation. For now, however, Im using the crouch animation to represent my knock out, and my crouch animation already as transitions in a state machine to go back to walking.
 
Without knowing how you have your player and animation blueprint set up, not easily. Or rather, it would be possible to make an example project, but it might be doing things in a fundamentally different way than your existing game content is.
 
A while ago I converted the 4 original campaigns to support 2 player coop so I could play them with my friend for the Definitive Edition. Decided to upload the scenario files for public use.The conversion changes all triggers and ai scripts to react to the additional 2nd player. Some maps are changed slightly, but i keep close to the original map and ai design as possible. For balance reasons I cut the starting units, resources and population limit in half for each player.
 
this is really a brilliant work, i have enjoyed doing the barbarossa campaign with my friend and it was blast doing it, and i really like the idea of cutting pop space into half as it opened an interesting strategy for me and my friend to do.
 
To other who played it any feedback would be appreciated. Anything you find broken or annoying especially for player 2 since i had to invent a lot of its start locations. But would like to hear about stuf like unit distribution, resources and other things as well.
 
I have not found anything broken, at all. As in SP Saladin 6 is challenging, while the others are way easier. I really want to congratulate for the excellent work. Very smart also the population split.
 
I may have only one suggestion, but it is more my personal preference. So take it as less important. The idea is to force the cooperation even more (as in Barbarossa 2). One simple thing may be to disable some buildings (or much better the units trained inside) for each player. For instance barracks, archery ranges, stables, and siege workshop. Even castles.
 
For example, a good idea may be to separate archery ranges and stables, so that the two players must be coordinated to play, like player 1 is forced to develop cavalry and player 2 is forced to develop archers or vice versa.
