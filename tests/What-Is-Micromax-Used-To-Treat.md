If well tolerated, double to 1 tablespoon twice a day before meals (total daily dose 30mL). Alternatively, mix the total daily dosage in a litre of water and drink throughout the day. Never add to hot water. Children should take smaller amounts based on fraction of adult body weight. Do not exceed recommended dose.
 
It is well known that these friendly bacteria inhibit the growth of unhealthy bacteria and other pathogens that would normally thrive in the warm, moist and nutrient-rich environment of the intestines, but research is now showing that they have many other important functions such as: breaking down undigested food (including certain carbohydrates); helping with the absorption of vital minerals (such as magnesium, calcium and iron), lipids, vitamins (such as K) and other nutrients; synthesising particular vitamins such as biotin and folate; adjusting our metabolism and weight; regulating the functioning of the immune system and the production of antibodies and cytokines that are then effective outside the gut as well; and modulating our nervous system, psychological wellbeing (including anxiety and depression) and even memory.

Modern diets (which are usually low in fibre, nutrient-poor and/or toxin-rich), antibiotic use (both internally and topically), and the rise in C-section births have all had a deleterious effect on our gut flora, significantly reducing the number of friendly bacterial species inside of us. Some even call this a mass extinction! In fact, research on hunter-gatherers around the world indicate that they have up to 50% more bacterial species and twice as many bacterial genes than we do. This means that in modern humans the vital biological processes mentioned above are not as efficient or effective, making our health more fragile.
 
Fortunately there is now an effective solution. Professor Teruo Higa in Japan has developed a very specific fermentation process that produces a perfect balance of approximately 80 different types of specific aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. These include lactic acid bacteria, yeast and photosynthetic bacteria and other accompanying species. (Even though the product contains yeast, it can actually be used to recover from yeast infections because the lactobacillus feed off the candida, producing peroxide in the process which further kills pathogens.)
 
This specific microbe combination, which Professor Higa calls effective microorganisms, are supremely effective at promoting richer and healthier bacterial colonies, inhibiting pathogenic ones, and even persuading neutral bacteria to act in healthy ways! They are able to do all this by introducing health-promoting genetic information into our gut flora systems, taking advantage of the rapid twenty minute generational cycle of bacteria. In this way, our gut flora is fundamentally changed for the better at the genetic level.
 
When taken orally with water, Micromax is extremely effective at balancing gastrointestinal flora and inhibiting gut pathogens. But it can also be used externally on the skin, and internally in an enema, as a vaginal douche or even as a sinus cleanse. After all, bacteria are not just important for gut health but are found all over our bodies where they play vital roles in keeping us healthy. In fact, Micromax can even be used on surfaces as a natural disinfectant to discourage the growth of harmful bacteria and other pathogens, without damaging healthy bacteria (which as we know causes problems ecologically).
 
**Allergens & potential side-effects:** Unlikely to cause allergies as common allergens not present. However, the initial gut disturbances can be mistaken for an allergic reaction so monitor closely. This is a detox reaction and digestion should normalise after 1-3 days.

Moxifloxacin is used to treat a variety of bacterial infections. This medication belongs to a class of drugs called quinolone antibiotics. It works by stopping the growth of bacteria.This antibiotic treats only bacterial infections. It will not work for virus infections (such as common cold, flu). Using any antibiotic when it is not needed can cause it to not work for future infections.
 
Read the Medication Guide and, if available, the Patient Information Leaflet provided by your pharmacist before you start using moxifloxacin and each time you get a refill. If you have any questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
 
Take this medication by mouth with or without food as directed by your doctor, usually once daily. The dosage and length of treatment are based on your medical condition and response to treatment. Drink plenty of fluids while taking this drug unless your doctor tells you otherwise.
 
Take this medication at least 4 hours before or 8 hours after taking other products that may bind to it, decreasing its effectiveness. Ask your pharmacist about the other products you take. Some examples include: quinapril, sucralfate, vitamins/minerals (including iron and zinc supplements), and products containing magnesium, aluminum, or calcium (such as antacids, calcium supplements).
 
Remember that this medication has been prescribed because your doctor has judged that the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects. Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects.
 
Tell your doctor right away if you have any serious side effects, including: unusual bruising/bleeding, signs of a new infection (such as sore throat that doesn't go away, fever), signs of kidney problems (such as change in the amount of urine), signs of liver problems (such as nausea/vomiting that doesn't stop, unusual tiredness, stomach/abdominal pain, yellowing eyes/skin, dark urine).
 
This medication may rarely cause a severe intestinal condition due to a bacteria called C. difficile. This condition may occur during treatment or weeks to months after treatment has stopped. Tell your doctor right away if you develop: diarrhea that doesn't stop, abdominal or stomach pain/cramping, blood/mucus in your stool.
 
Use of this medication for prolonged or repeated periods may result in oral thrush or a new yeast infection. Contact your doctor if you notice white patches in your mouth, a change in vaginal discharge, or other new symptoms.
 
A very serious allergic reaction to this drug is rare. However, get medical help right away if you notice any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction, including: rash, itching/swelling (especially of the face/tongue/throat), severe dizziness, trouble breathing.
 
In Canada - Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to Health Canada at 1-866-234-2345. Warnings Quinolone antibiotics (including moxifloxacin) may cause serious and possibly permanent tendon damage (such as tendonitis, tendon rupture), nerve problems in the arms and legs (peripheral neuropathy), and nervous system problems. Get medical help right away if you have any of the following symptoms: pain/numbness/burning/tingling/weakness in your arms/hands/legs/feet, changes in how you sense touch/pain/temperature/vibration/body position, severe/lasting headache, vision changes, shaking (tremors), seizures, mental/mood changes (such as agitation, anxiety, confusion, hallucinations, depression, rare thoughts of suicide).
 
Tendon damage may occur during or after treatment with this medication. Stop exercising, rest, and get medical help right away if you develop joint/muscle/tendon pain or swelling. Your risk for tendon problems is greater if you are over 60 years of age, if you are taking corticosteroids (such as prednisone), or if you have a kidney, heart, or lung transplant.
 
This medication may make a certain muscle condition (myasthenia gravis) worse. Tell your doctor right away if you have new or worsening muscle weakness (such as drooping eyelids, unsteady walk) or trouble breathing.
 
Before using this medication, tell your doctor or pharmacist your medical history, especially of: diabetes, heart problems (such as recent heart attack), joint/tendon problems (such as tendonitis, bursitis), liver disease, mental/mood disorders (such as depression), myasthenia gravis, nerve problems (such as peripheral neuropathy), seizure disorder, conditions that increase your risk of seizures (such as brain/head injury, brain tumors, cerebral atherosclerosis), blood vessel problems (such as aneurysm or blockage of the aorta or other blood vessels, hardening of the arteries), high blood pressure, certain genetic conditions (Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome).
 
Moxifloxacin may cause a condition that affects the heart rhythm (QT prolongation). QT prolongation can rarely cause serious (rarely fatal) fast/irregular heartbeat and other symptoms (such as severe dizziness, fainting) that need medical attention right away.
 
Low levels of potassium or magnesium in the blood may also increase your risk of QT prolongation. This risk may increase if you use certain drugs (such as diuretics/"water pills") or if you have conditions such as severe sweating, diarrhea, or vomiting. Talk to your doctor about using moxifloxacin safely.
