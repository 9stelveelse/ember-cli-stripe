Preface: I've been a Minecraft player for quite a while now. I think I started following the game during 2013-14 in 1.7, the Update That Changed The World, as I remember the snapshots for 1.8. I played the legacy console version a bit, but mainly played Pocket Edition starting in 2016. I remember the nether reactor core, the hoops you'd have to jump through to get mods (BlockLauncher and Cydia, anyone?). Around 1.12 I switched to Java Edition, but I was "sailing the seven seas" if you know what I man, and didn't buy the actual game until around the beginning of Covid - my account is new enough that it was always a Microsoft account from the beginning and never was migrated.

However, I don't have any old worlds. I've deleted worlds to save space, i've lost computers and phones, one time I accidentally deleted the application support file for Minecraft (and all the worlds within) when trying to recover worlds on an old computer. My oldest surviving world is a survival world from 1.16 and a creative world from the same version. None of my worlds are ones where I upgraded throughout all the versions.
 
I've also been getting into the "Golden Age" of Minecraft - that is, old versions of the gam. the GoldenAgeMinecraft subreddit describes it as 1.2.5 or earlier, and most people on that sub define it as beta 1.7.3 or earlier - the last version before the Adventure Update, a 2-part update (b1.8 and release 1.0) that combined that added sprinting, hunger, Endermen, villages, more types of meat, Mineshafts in part 1, and brewing, enchanting, the end and ender dragon in part 2, as well as an overhaul of the terrain generation. These changes were controversial to some, and many people still prefer beta 1.7.3 over modern versions. I'm not one of those people (personally I like 1.12.2 best for modding potential), but I do appreciate these versions of minecraft.
 
As such, I have decided to play every single version of Minecraft, starting with the oldest pre-classic versions, and continuing through classic, Indev, into Infdev. Starting in Infdev (specifically inf-20100327), I'll be able to keep the same world. I'll keepg going through Alpha, Beta, and the full release, until the most recent version - 1.20.1 at the time of writing, but hopefully it will be at least 1.21 by the time I reach the end. By beta 1.8 I'll also create a creative test world. After that it just becomes a normal world. Every snapshot, every pre-release and release candidate, even the weird versions, like the April Fools versions, the experimental snapshots from 1.18 and 1.19, the combat tests will be played at some point.
 
This wouldn't be possible if it weren't for the Betacraft launcher and the OmniArchive team. They're responsible for the archival of many versions of the game that would otherwise not be available as they're not found in the vanilla launcher. The Betacraft launcher also fixes several problems with old versions, such as bugs related to music and sounds and skins. I recommend checking it out.

Without further ado, let's start with pc-132011 (rd-13211). When you open this version you find yourself in a flatland of only grass. If you break the grass with right-click, you reveal cobblestone underneath. Building works differently in this version, as the break and place controls are inverted, and you can only place cobblestone, accept at ground level when you instead place grass. Even such, I was able do build quite a nice castle complex with an underground throne room.
 


The first thing I noticed is that my world was entirely stone, from my builds, to the ground and underground. I now had access to planks, dirt, and cobble, as well as stone. I can now summon humans with pressing G, so I did. I also upgraded my base with the new blocks.
 
I recall watching a Youtube video in turn looking back at some of the oldest videos of Minecraft, rd-classic era, a player placing dirt and stone when that was all there was to play with, the Mario pixel art and so forth, and a statement is made "it's like watching a primitive man discover fire". I have some deep and sorrowful feelings about what the game has ultimately become but at the same time it's fascinating and unique that its entire history from such tiny humble beginnings is available to explore in this way.
 
TheMasterCaver's First World - possibly the most caved-out world in Minecraft history - includes world download.
TheMasterCaver's World - my own version of Minecraft largely based on my views of how the game should have evolved since 1.6.4.
Why do I still play in 1.6.4?
 


0.0.9a changed the building mode system and fixed an issue in which you could place blocks inside yourself. As a side note, in the time before the Minecraft Bug Tracker, bugs were tracked on the Minecraft Wiki itself.
 


0,0,11a was the first public released version of minecraft, posted on the TIGsource Forum as Minecraft (alpha), and was released only a week after the pre-classic tests. As such, the oldest minecraft videos are from this version. The archived version is actually a development version for 0.0.12a.
 


There are four new blocks that you can place, meaning the keys 1-9 all have blocks bound to them. These blocks are sand, gravel, log, and leaves. Log and Leaves are pretty ordinary blocks, though leaves are useful for windows due to their transparency. Sand and Gravel always teleport down to the ground below. I used them to expand my house with a back room.
 
I've seen videos of pre-Classic and Classic water/lava physics. Very interesting. There's an extinct minigame using those physics - Lava Survival. Players would be allowed a period of time to fortify before a lava source was placed up high causing the entire map to be drowned in lava.
 
My first experience was with Minecraft Pocket Edition, back when it still had very limited worlds (256x256 according to what I could find online). It was such a different experience - I knew what was in the world was very limited. There might be only one place with a forest, and of course there wasn't any opportunity for the wide ranging exploration I like. I still managed to have a lot of fun; it was pretty good for learning the game.
 
The second test changed the animation for human mobs and players but it played too fast. Test 3 fixed some bugs. Test 4 added visible usernames above players and re-added particles to multiplayer. Test 5 added chat, available by pressing T. Test 6 changed code, and it had a minor bug (the version not working at all). Test 7 had a bug, and test 8 fixed a bug and added another.
 
Glass, when added, had a unique texture that was transluscent, then a more scratched texture, but that was in 0.0.19a\_01-3, this is \_04. It has the unique function of being seethrough like leaves, which means yo can make proper windows!
 
Sponge, on the other hand, has the function of deleting nearby water in a 2 block radius (5x5 total) - very useful, since water can flood anything in this version of the game. What did I use this for? Making a small underwater base. With a swim tunnel to escape.
 
I created a darkroom and filled it with all 5 plants - after a little they all dissapear (the grass also turns to dirt in the dark oddly enough). All 5 plants have the same behavior - they disspaear if floating if not on dirt or grass, fade away in the dark, and have no hitbox. They also seem smaller.
 
The visual editor is - well, the words it deserves would get me banned for profanity. I ended up composing in a text editor, with the various formatting commands entered manually, and pasting in. If I have to fix a typo or whatever I do it in the text editor and re-paste.
 
All those buildings look simplistic now, but I remember when they all looked so amazing. Something like Minecraft had long been "in the air"; I and many other people had thought something where you could just place and move blocks would be just so cool. It was just so amazing when it actually happened.
 
I came to Minecraft from Dwarf Fortress. In the early days some DF players were very unhappy feeling that Notch was ripping off DF and there was a degree of resentment towards Minecraft in the DF community. He did indeed name DF as an inspiration along with Infiniminer. I recall a DF forums thread where someone had somehow converted a save to load in a very early version of Minecraft, probably Classic, and it absolutely blew my mind that they were able to walk around their fortress in first person 3d. There had been 3d visualizers for DF before but never interactive. That was my first exposure to Minecraft. I wish I could remember which fortress it was - maybe Nist Akath or even Boatmurdered.
 
The Classic Creative images remind me so much of that. There's a similar look to the builds even though DF structures must be built layer by layer from a 2d overhead view. I hadn't thought about that in years! Now I'm wondering what some of the great historic DF megaprojects like the Colossus of Cacame would have looked like in Minecraft.
 
Lately, I've been messing with old Minecraft versions as a hobby. I want to do a new play through where I start at Pre-Classic 0.0.0, and I update the game after every day (or every 20 minutes for the versions before the day/night cycle was added).
 
My main problem is that any version before Infdev won't save the world in .minecraft/saves. They exist somewhere though, because the house thing I built in Pre-Classic is still there when I play that version.
