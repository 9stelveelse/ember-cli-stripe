Dick Jensen (USA) designed Serpentine, is a contemporary-looking display font, for the Visual Graphics Corporation in 1972. With the rise of digital typesetting and desktop publishing, this typeface quickly became both popular and ubiquitous. This dynamic, wide, boxy design is identifiable via tiny triangular swellings at the stroke endings - what might be called semi-serifs. Serpentine is available in six different font styles: Light, Light Oblique, Medium, Medium Oblique, Bold, and Bold Oblique.

Serpentine" is a greenish rock that sometimes resembles a serpent's skin, and is often used as a decorative stone in architecture. Though this font doesn't seem at all snaky or sinuous, it does have an architectural, stone-like solidity. The subtle, almost non-existent curves and semi-serifs keep it from being too stern or cold. Although the underlying strokes of each weight are similar, the six members of the Serpentine font family all present their own individual personalities. Serpentine Light lends itself well to text for onscreen displays, for instance, while the numbers from typeface's heavier weights are seen around the world on soccer jerseys! Additionally, the oblique styles convey a streamlined sense of speed, furthermore lending Serpentine well to sport and athletic applications (especially the faster, high-speed varieties).

Because of its 1970s pedigree, Serpentine has come to be known as a genuine "retro" face. This makes the typeface even more appropriate for display usage, in applications such as logo design, magazine headlines, and party flyers.

Years ago I purchased the Serpentine Font from adobe. I reloaded my laptop and installed Office 2019. The font no longer works with MS Office. It does work with Office 2010 and it work in Wordpad. I fond an articel that said Windows no longer works hith PS fonts. How do I get a version that will work with Office.
 
Glad you are up and going. As I indicated, it was Microsoft's decision to end support of Type 1 fonts in Office. FWIW, Wordpad hasn't been updated in years and simply wasn't worth Microsoft's time to muck with the Wordpad code simply to remove that support.

Either the response was very good or the editors just liked it because in 1982 they put the Joe Simon logo back on the cover for a long run, with the addition of a full figure of Cap in action in front of a large star. Both new elements give the old logo support and interest, and I think it still works well. The style of the letterforms seems surprisingly timeless, not suggesting the 1940s in particular.
 
Cap got a new logo in 1991, a strongly arced version of the 1960s letterforms, also in one point perspective receding toward the top, and with the open drop shadow below. The flag stripes are back, but the unknown-to-me designer mitigated their impact by giving the main letters a heavy black outline, increasing readability. This is not a bad look, though the severity of the arc makes it seem a bit too compressed horizontally.
 
In 1995 I was asked by Marvel to submit sketches for a new Cap logo design. I was working on my first Mac computer just a short time then, and decided to try using it for this assignment. Initially I prepared four samples on the computer and sent them in.
 
Version 2 began with a font called Serpentine Bold, which was designed by Dick Jensen in 1972 and soon become a staple on book covers, movie posters and advertising everywhere. It still seemed fresh to me then, I liked the thick and thin strokes and small pointed serifs, and I had fun creating this version using two-point perspective and telescoping.
 
These final samples use the font Albertus, one with a classic feel. It was designed in 1938, but feels much older, harking back to Roman times. An interesting idea, but not a great success for this assignment.
