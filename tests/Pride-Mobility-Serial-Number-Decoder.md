It ensures that the electrical devices and components within the mobility scooter receive a consistent and safe voltage level, even as the battery's charge level changes, and we need the serial number to confirm the compatibility of the part you need.

Mobility Direct works with reputable manufacturing companies and importers that are typically willing to support our customers in good faith when an item is defective or damaged upon receipt.

Items that are incompatible are not eligible for returns in most cases, please review the information on this page before placing your order.
 
We do not guarantee shipping delivery times. Once an item is shipped, you will be subject to the return policy. If your item has not shipped, you can request a cancellation and we will issue a 100% refund to the payment method that was used to purchase the part.

If you order a part from our website, without providing a serial number to a parts department agent from Mobility Direct, you may lose the right to return an item. We do not accept returns due to compatibility issues unless you provide the serial number for the product you are ordering a part for. Serial numbers need to be provided to a Mobility Direct parts department member via phone or email. You can also provide your product's serial number while adding an item to your cart, and our team will review the compatibility before shipping the item. If you ordered an item that is not compatible, and we received your serial number prior to making the purchase, then we may issue a return authorization. Returns will only be considered when a serial number is provided. No exceptions.
 
Warranty coverage is provided by the manufacturer of the part you order from Mobility Direct. Our manufacturing partners decide whether or not a warranty claim is approved, not Mobility Direct. Mobility Direct does not provide warranty support or claim approval for parts. If you receive an item that is defective, you can contact Mobility Direct's customer service department to request a warranty claim for you. Mobility Direct agents will contact the manufacturer on your behalf and request approval for a warranty claim if the item is defective or arrives damaged. If the manufacturer denies the warranty claim request, Mobility Direct is not capable or required to take any further action.
 
Mobility Direct at its sole discretion will decide if a part is eligible for a return based on several factors. The first factor will be if the serial number was provided when making the purchase. Most scooters, power wheelchairs, lift chairs, and vehicle lifts go through version updates. When version updates are made, parts may become incompatible with the older versions. The compatibility of parts is dependent on the serial number of your product, therefore, it is strongly advised that you provide a serial number when making a purchase to ensure that it will be compatible with your product. You can provide a serial number to any of our agents via email, or phone or when checking out on our website. If you do not provide a serial number prior to making a purchase, your part order will not be eligible for a return.
 
You may also call (877) 460-1646 to request a return. Once a return request has been made, we will review the sales order, and associated communication with our team to decide if a return authorization is going to be provided or not.
 
If you receive a return authorization from one of our agents, you may be required to repack the item in the original packaging to have it shipped back. You may be responsible for the cost of the return shipping. All parts are subject to a 20% restocking fee. If one of our agents recommended a part that is not compatible with your model, we may waive the restocking fee and return shipping fee in good faith. Mobility Direct may provide a pre-paid return shipping label at its own discretion.
