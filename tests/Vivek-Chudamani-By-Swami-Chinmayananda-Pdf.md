Rather than reading the Upanishads themselves, you might prefer to read a modern 're-telling' and interpretation. The following are extremely good and are highly recommended.

Anand Hudli's site advaitasiddhi specifically addresses this classical work by madhusUdana saraswatI, which defends advaita against the objections of the mAdhva-s or dvaitins. In particular there are extended definitions and analyses of the meaning of the term mithyA.
 
Many books (transcription of talks) by Swami Paramarthananda are available at www.arshaavinash.in.

The text discusses key concepts such as the *viveka* (discrimination or discernment) between real (unchanging, eternal) and unreal (changing, temporal), Prakriti and Atman, the oneness of Atman and Brahman, and self-knowledge as the central task of spiritual life and for Moksha.[10][3][11] It expounds the Advaita Vedanta philosophy in the form of a self-teaching manual, with many verses in the form of a dialogue between a student and a spiritual teacher.
 
According to Reza Shah-Kazemi the authorship of Shankara is doubtful,[4] though it is "so closely interwoven into the spiritual heritage of Shankara that any analysis of his perspective which fails to consider [this work] would be incomplete".[4] [note 1] According to Michael Comans, a scholar of Advaita Vedanta, though the Hindu tradition popularly believes that Adi Shankara authored the *Vivekachudamani*, this is "most probably erroneous".[5] Comans gives the following reasons for his doubts: the highly poetic style of the *Vivekachudamani* is not found in other genuine works of Adi Shankara; there is a lack of extensive commentaries (*bhasya*) on the *Vivekachudamani* which is unusual given the extensive commentaries on his other works; and unlike Shankara's other genuine works which give minimal importance to nirvikalpa *samadhi* practices, the *Vivekachudamani* gives special importance to it.[5] Though the *Vivekachudamani* is a popular manual on Vedanta, it is probably the work of a later Shankara, and not Adi Shankara, states Comans.[5] Yet another theory, states Berger, is that "rather than simply having been written or not written by [Adi] Shankara, the Crown Jewel of Discrimination may be a corporately authored work [of Advaita monasteries] that went through revisions".[2]
 
According to Natalia Isayeva, a scholar of Advaita Vedanta, it is "far less probable" that Adi Shankara authored the *Vivekachudamani*.[6] Sengaku Mayeda, another scholar of Indian Philosophy and Advaita Vedanta, states that though widely accepted as Shankara's work, the *Vivekachudamani* is likely not his work.[7]
 
Paul Hacker, an Indologist and scholar of Advaita, set out a methodology for ascertaining authorship of Advaita texts and he concluded that though the *Vivekachudmani* is unusual in parts, it was likely authored by Adi Shankara.[2][8] Hacker stated that the definitions of the key concepts, premises and ideas found in the *Vivekachudmani* match with those in Shankara's established authentic works.[2] Daniel H. H. Ingalls Sr., another influential Indologist, rejected Hacker's conclusion by accepting Hacker's methodology and presenting evidence from its manuscripts that some of the ideas in the text do not fully agree with those of Adi Shankara.[2][8]
 
According to John Grimes, a professor of Hinduism and Buddhism known for his translation of the *Vivekachudamani*, "modern scholars tend to reject that Adi Shankara composed Vivekachudamani, while traditionalists tend to accept it", and there is an unending "arguments and counter-arguments" about its authorship.[12] Grimes states that his work strengthens the case that "there is still a likelihood that Śaṅkara is the author of the Vivekacūḍāmaṇi," [12] noting that "a strong case can be made that the Vivekacūḍāmaṇi is a genuine work of Shankara's and that it differs in certain respects from his other works in that it addresses itself to a different audience and has a different emphasis and purpose."[13][2]
 
Irrespective of the attribution, the *Vivekachudmani* is a significant work of Advaita*.* According to Swami Dayananda Saraswati, a Vedanta teacher, "I do not think we lose anything even if the authorship is attributed to any other Sankaracharya of one of the various Sankara-mathas."[14]
 
Many historic manuscripts of the *Vivekachudamani* have been found in different monasteries of Advaita Vedanta. These have minor variations, and a critical edition of these has not been published yet.[1] The earliest original Sanskrit manuscript of the *Vivekachudamani* was published from Srirangam (Tamil Nadu) by T.K. Balasubramania Iyer in 1910.[1] This edition has attracted much of 20th- and 21st-century scholarship, and has been republished in 1983 after some revision and re-arrangement to reflect studies on it since 1910. Other editions have been the basis of a few Indian translations. The five most referred to manuscripts in Advaita scholarship have been published by Samata (Chennai), Advaita Ashrama (Kolkata), Sri Ramakrishna Math (Chennai), Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan (Mumbai), Chinmayananda Ashrama (Mumbai).[1]
 
The text begins with salutations to Govinda, which can be interpreted either as referring to God or to his guru Sri Govinda Bhagavatpada.[16] It then expounds the significance of Self Realisation, ways to reach it, and the characteristics of a Guru. It criticises attachment to the body and goes to explain the various bodies (*śarīra*), sheaths (*kośa*), qualities (*guṇa*), senses, and energies (*prāṇa*) which constitute the Anatman.[17] It teaches the disciple the ways to attain Self-realisation, methods of meditation (dhyana) and introspection of the Atman. The*Vivekachudamani* describes the characteristics of an enlightened human being (*Jivanmukta*)[18] and a person of steady wisdom (*Sthitaprajna*) on the lines of Bhagavad Gita.[19]
 
The *Vivekachudmani* has been celebrated as a lucid introductory treatise to Advaita Vedanta.[2] It is, states Berger, not a "philosophical or polemical" text. It is primarily a pedagogical treatise, as an aid to an Advaitin's spiritual journey to liberation rather than "philosophy for the sake of philosophy". It is one of the texts of "spiritual sustenance" in the Advaita tradition.[2]
 
There are two Sanskrit commentaries on this work. Sri Sacchidananda Shivabhinava Nrusimha Bharati, the pontiff of Sringeri, wrote a commentary titled *Vivekodaya* (Dawn of Discrimination) on the first seven verse
