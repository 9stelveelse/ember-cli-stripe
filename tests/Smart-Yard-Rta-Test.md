If you're preparing for your driving license test in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), you'll likely encounter the RTA Smart Yard Test. This test is a crucial step towards obtaining your driving license in the UAE. In this article, we will break down everything you need to know about the RTA Smart Yard Test in an easy-to-understand manner.
 
To evaluate the driving abilities of prospective license holders, the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) in the United Arab Emirates has devised a cutting-edge and effective method. The purpose of the Smart Yard Test is to assess a driver's fundamental driving skills in the Smart Yard, a safe setting. Since the examiner won't be there, you'll be taking the yard test in a Smart Yard. After this, you'll feel more comfortable driving a car. It also shields the examiner from any errors brought on by human error.

Sensors and advanced cameras are used to decide if you will pass or fail. There are twenty sensors and five cameras on each vehicle. Using video recognition and processing techniques, these cameras and sensors look at the car's motion and parking lines. Please remember to do so in addition to doing a vehicle inspection because a sensor is also used to verify if you have fastened your seatbelt. If you commit any errors, points will be deducted, and the RTA will decide whether you passed or failed the RTA Smart Yard Test based on the total amount of points deducted.
 
In conclusion, the RTA Smart Yard Test is a vital part of the process of obtaining a driving license in the UAE. By enrolling at Excellence Driving, understanding the components of the test, and preparing diligently, you can increase your chances of passing the test with flying colors. Remember, practice makes perfect, and maintaining a calm demeanor during the test is key to success. Safe driving and best of luck on your Smart Yard Test!

Proper soil sampling ensures accurate test results and gives the best recommendations. A typical soil test report shows soil pH, soil nutrient levels (phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium), limestone recommendations, and additions needed.

Properly fertilized lawns absorb pollutants and reduce soil erosion and ambient air temperatures in summer. Overfertilizing aggravates pest problems, stimulates excessive growth, requires more maintenance, and can lead to fertilizer runoff.
 
Mowing, pruning, and raking generate yard waste. Dumping this waste into storm drains or waterways harms aquatic habitats and is illegal. Composting recycles plant nutrients and keeps an on-site resource on site.

The Marin Wildfire Prevention Authority (MWPA) funded a study to determine the relative combustibility of various popular mulch products. Choosing the right mulch in wildfire prone areas is important. Some mulches can ignite and spread fire quickly. Others are less easily ignited and take longer to burn. Questions about the safety of various types of mulch are some of the most common questions asked by homeowners. Until now, there has been a lack of scientific data to compare various mulch products.
 
The mulch study took place at the Marin County Fire Department Admin Headquarters at the San Geronimo Golf Course from October 10-12th. Ten different mulch products were separated into piles and allowed to dry and weather to simulate the condition of mulch found in Marin yards and landscapes. Each mulch was placed into three circular piles approximately 8 feet in diameter and 3 inches deep. After the material had weathered for four months, the material was ignited. Instruments were placed to measure flame length, rate of flame spread, and radiant heat. Stay tuned for results.
 
Another evaluation of mulch combustibility was performed in 2008 by the University of California Cooperative Extension and the University of Nevada Cooperative Extension. This study resulted in recommendations for mulch use in wildfire hazard areas.
 
The study defines mulch as any material that is used to cover the soil surface for a variety of purposes. Mulches can be classified as organic or inorganic. Organic mulches usually come from plant materials and include pine needles, pine bark nuggets, shredded western cedar, and even ground or shredded rubber. Inorganic mulches consist of rock, gravel, and brick chips. These inorganic mulches do not burn and are safe to use in any setting.
 
Eight mulch treatments were evaluated for three characteristics: flame height, rate of fire spread, and temperature. On the test day, the National Fire Danger Rating System value was Extreme. All eight mulches were found to be combustible but varied considerably in the three areas measured.

Yard tests are conducted to test the basic skills of trainee drivers before they are taken out on the road for the final stage of training. The test has five components: parallel parking, roadside parking (60 degrees inclination), garage parking, slope (hill), and sudden braking.
 
The automation process has the Test Yard fitted with five surveillance cameras; four of them outside the vehicle to guide the candidate to the locations of the five maneuvers. The fifth camera is fitted on board the test vehicle to verify the identity of the driver during the test.
 
He said that the captured images are transmitted to an interactive screen in a control tower installed in the testing yard where a staff will retrieve the results and use them in the assessment of the candidate.
 
Are you planning a landscaping project this year? Yard Smart Rain Rewards is an exciting opportunity for Kirkland homeowners to beautify their yards and help keep polluted rainwater runoff out of Lake Washington.
 
Qualified homes can take advantage of free technical assistance and rebates to install beautiful projects like rain gardens, native landscaping, and cisterns on their property to manage rainwater runoff.
 
Every time it rains, water picks up and carries pollutants from our roofs, driveways, patios, and lawns, into the nearest storm drain, and finally into the nearest creek and Lake Washington. During big storms, the amount of rainwater runoff can cause neighborhood flooding and erosion hazards.
 
**All Kirkland property owners are potentially eligible\*. However, only properties with downspouts currently connected to the City's stormwater drainage system are eligible for rebates. Properties with downspouts that are already disconnected are not eligible for rebates in 2023.**
 
If your property has downspouts that connect into the ground, **you may be eligible**. Yard Smart staff will help verify whether your downspouts are connected and determine your eligibility at your site visit. The photos below demonstrate what connected and disconnected downspouts might look like:
 
\* Yard Smart rebates cannot be used to install any projects to help meet the requirements of a permit or City code. Properties with an active building or development permit must wait until their project is complete and permit is finalized before becoming eligible for Yard Smart rebates.
 
Yard Smart Rain Rewards consultations are a free service to help find the project right for you, your landscape, your budget, and your goals. In order to be eligible to receive a Rain Rewards rebate, all participants must first complete a Yard Smart consultation.

Consultations consist of a 60 minute site visit that will take place at your property with one of our Yard Smart staff.
 
Please note: We ask that you please reschedule your site visit if you currently have Covid-19, are experiencing any Covid-like symptoms, or have recently been exposed to someone with a positive Covid-19 test result.
 
Eligible project types include rain gardens, rain capture cisterns, and native landscaping. All projects must result in at least 400 square feet of impervious surface being disconnected from the City's stormwater drainage system. Case by case exceptions can be made for smaller areas. Rebates will be awarded at a rate of $7.50 per square foot of impervious surface managed.
 
Once Yard Smart staff conducts a site visit on your property, we will send you a written report that includes a list of site-specific project options to reduce runoff from your property.

You can install more the one project on your property. Rebates ranges from 75 percent to 100 percent of project costs, up to $5,000 or $
