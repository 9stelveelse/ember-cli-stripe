Either way, *Blood Follows* serves as the first novella and is the best introduction to the novella series. Readers may find the story flows much more naturally if the novellas are read in chronological order rather than published order.

**Recommendation:** The published order is the best order in which to read this series for the first time. The series is written in a style very different from the main series and spoilers go both ways.
 
**Recommendation:** The published order is the best order in which to read this series for the first time. We currently do not have a definite recommendation where to slot this trilogy into the overall reading order of the books. *Dancer's Lament* could be used as an alternate entry point into the Malazan universe for those who find *Gardens of the Moon* too much of a challenge as it does not spoil major plot developments for the main series although it does contain some spoilers. The same however applies the other way round in about equal measure.
 
**Recommendation:** The published order is the best order in which to read this series for the first time. This trilogy should be read after completing the ten book Malazan Book of the Fallen series.

There are numerous ways that all the series of the Malazan World can be combined into a single read order. For first-time readers, care must be taken to avoid reading things too far out of chronological order such that events do not make sense, as well as avoiding any events being spoiled before reading through them happening.
 
In November 2017, Erikson and Esslemont's North American publisher Tor posted an article entitled "The Malazan Authors' Suggested Reading Order for the Series Is Not What You Would Expect". The list is strictly chronological by storyline. Although said to be approved by the authors, neither is quoted in the article. Fans have been skeptical over the list, considering it places two unfinished (at the time) prequel trilogies at its start. One fan on reddit.com claimed to have contacted Erikson about the article. In the response posted by the fan, Erikson said the article likely spawned from a chronological listing he and Esslemont had put together for Tor several years earlier.[1]

***Malazan Book of the Fallen*** /məˈlzən/[1] is a series of epic fantasy novels written by the Canadian author Steven Erikson. The series, published by Bantam Books in the U.K. and Tor Books in the U.S., consists of ten volumes, beginning with *Gardens of the Moon* (1999) and concluding with *The Crippled God* (2011). Erikson's series presents the narratives of a large cast of characters spanning thousands of years across multiple continents.[2][3][4][5]
 
The series has received widespread critical acclaim, with reviewers praising the epic scope, plot complexity and characterizations, and fellow authors such as Glen Cook (*The Black Company*) and Stephen R. Donaldson (*The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant*) hailing it as a masterwork of the imagination, and comparing Erikson to the likes of Joseph Conrad, Henry James, William Faulkner, and Fyodor Dostoevsky.[7][8][9]
 
In an interview with a Spanish fantasy blog, Erikson said that the hand-drawn version of the Malazan world which he had at home was too large to be photocopied; however, he also said that the maps created by fans were coming close.[12]
 
The Malazan planet has at least four moons. Although only one is easily visible from the surface and known to the general population, three other moons are perpetually occluded from the sun's light. Early historical texts suggested that they were not always so difficult to see.[13] Constellations visible from the world included the Roads of the Abyss and the Dagger.[14][15]
 
There are at least six continents on the Malazan world according to *Midnight Tides*.[16] However, *Return of the Crimson Guard* suggests twelve major landmasses exist.[17] The definition of what constitutes a "continent", "subcontinent" or large island in the world has never been firmly defined.
 
The largest continent on the Malazan world has no overall name. This landmass's eastern region (comprising roughly one-third of the entire landmass) is known as Seven Cities. This region is separated from the rest of the landmass by the vast Jhag Odhan. To the west of this lies the kingdoms of Nemil and Perish, whilst to the south-west lies the substantial Shal-Morzinn Empire.
 
South of Seven Cities lies the Falari Isles and the small continent of Quon Tali. Quon Tali is the heartland of the Malazan Empire, which was born on an island just off its southern coast. The island of Drift Avalii is located some distance off its south-western coast.
 
The narrow Strait of Storms divides Malaz Island from the continent of Korelri. Korelri is a large landmass comprising two subcontinents, Fist and Stratem. Fist consists of a vast number of islands and a part of the adjacent landmass. The Aurgatt Range divides the lands of Fist from Stratem.[18] Stratem consists of several peninsulas, divided from one another by a large inlet known as the Sea of Chimes.
 
South-west of Korelri and Quon Tali, beyond a vast field of floating ice, lies the small island-continent of Jacuruku. Jacuruku is a land of harsh extremes, with burning deserts on the western side and verdant jungle on the eastern.
 
East of Seven Cities and north-east of Quon Tali, across Seeker's Deep, lies the continent of Genabackis. Genabackis is a narrow but long continent stretching for many hundreds of leagues from north to south. To the east of Genabackis lies the Genostel Archipelago, comprising one large island (itself large enough to be counted as a subcontinent) and many smaller ones. Further east still is the Cabal Archipelago, which may lie closer to the far western coast of Seven Cities.
 
Due east of Quon Tali and south-east of Genabackis lies the continent of Assail. This is a long landmass comprising two distinct regions, Assail proper (which is regarded as a land of unrelenting hostility) and a more civilised peninsula area in the south, known as Bael.
 
East of Assail, south of western Seven Cities and south-west of Jacuruku, lies the large continent of Lether, named for its largest nation. Isolated from the rest of the world by distance and the immense ice fields near Jacuruku, Lether had little contact with other lands and nations prior to the arrival of the renegade Malazan 14th Army.
 
The Kharkanas Trilogy is a prequel series written by Steven Erikson after the completion of the main series. The series deals with the Tiste before their split into darkness, light and shadow. It sheds light on the events that are often hinted at in the background of *Malazan Book of the Fallen*. Many of the important Tiste characters from the *Malazan Book of the Fallen* make an appearance like Anomander Rake, Draconus, Spinnock Durav and Andarist.
 
The Path to Ascendancy is a prequel series set in the world of Malazan, written by Ian Cameron Esslemont.[20] The stories deal with the early adventures of Dancer and Kellanved (Dorin and Wu, in this series) and their eventual rise to power on Quon Tali.
 
This is the main series, written by Steven Erikson, and commenced, in terms of publication order, before any of the other series. This first novel, *Gardens of the Moon*, was shortlisted for a World Fantasy Award. The second novel, *Deadhouse Gates*, was voted one of the ten best fantasy novels of 2000 by SF Site.[24] See the structure section below for more information.
 
Six-part novel series set in the world of Malazan. It was written by Ian Cameron Esslemont. The novels cover events simultaneous with the Book of the Fallen, like the mystery of the Crimson Guard, the succession of the Malazan Empire, the situation on Korel and Jacuruku and the mystery of Assail. Some of these events are hinted at during the course of the Malazan Book of the Fallen. Characters that appear throughout the novels are Kyle, Greymane and the avowed members of the Crimson Guard like Shimmer, Blues, K'azz, Skinner and Cowl.
 
The first three novellas were published together as *The Tales of Bauchelain and Korbal Broach, Volume 1*. *The Tales of Bauchelain and Korbal Broach, Volume 2* includes the second three novellas.
 
Erikson and Esslemont recommend reading the books in order of publication.[31] *Tor.com* published a reading order based on the approximate chronological order of events in the series,[32] which the authors did not consider suitable as a reading order for a first-time reader.[31]The publication order of the series is as follows:
 
The Malazan world was originally created by Steven Erikson and Ian Cameron Esslemont in 1982 as a backdrop for role-playing games using a modified version of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons.[33] By 1986, when the GURPS system had been adopted by Erikson and Esslemont,[6] the world had become much larger and more complex, approaching its current scope. It was then developed into a movie script entitled *Gardens of the Moon*. When this was not successful in finding interest, the two writers agreed to each write a series set in their shared world.[33] Steven Erikson wrote *Gardens of the Moon* as a novel in the period 1991-92 but it was not published until 1999. In the meantime, he wrote several non-fantasy novels. When he sold *Gardens of the Moon*, he agreed to a contract for an additional nine volumes in the series. The contract with Banta
