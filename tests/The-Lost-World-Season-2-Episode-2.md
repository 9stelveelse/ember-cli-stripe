***The Lost World*** (officially ***Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World***) is a syndicated television series loosely based on the 1912 novel by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, *The Lost World*. The show premiered in the United States in the fall of 1999 (after the TV-movie/pilot aired in February on DirecTV and then on the cable television channel TNT in April).[1] It ran for three seasons, the final two of which aired in syndication in the United States, before it was cancelled in 2002 after funding for a fourth season fell through. The final episode ended with an unresolved cliffhanger. All three seasons were released in DVD box sets in 2004.
 
"At the dawn of the 20th century" a band of British adventurers, led by adventurer and scholar Professor George Challenger, embark on an expedition to prove the existence of an isolated lost world. The group, some mismatched enthusiasts with less than selfless reasons for making the journey, consists of Challenger, Professor Arthur Summerlee, Marguerite Krux, Major Lord John Richard Roxton and Edward T. Malone.

Their hot air balloon crashes in the Amazon rainforest on an uncharted plateau where prehistoric creatures survive. The group is assisted by a young jungle-savvy woman named Veronica Layton, whose parents disappeared eleven years before. Her family was part of a research group known to have vanished under mysterious circumstances. Together, the group fights to survive against carnivorous dinosaurs, vicious Neanderthals, a race of lizard men, and other perils as they search for a way to escape. Each episode detailed two separate, simultaneous adventures.
 
The new season would have also revealed that Marguerite and Roxton were always meant to be together from the beginning. As Veronica is the new Protector of the Plateau, Marguerite is a descendant of *Morrighan*, a druid priestess who once served as "third power" within the Trion forces between the Protectors and the line of Mordren. As with her ancestor, Marguerite would have been a free will agent allowed to choose good or evil in the battle against power over the Plateau. Roxton, Marguerite's knight, protector, and future groom, would have been her personal guide so that Marguerite would ultimately choose "good". Because Morrighan's line descends from a child born to a Protector and the line of Mordren and Veronica's bloodline is of the Protectors, Veronica and Marguerite are cousins genetically, but spiritually are sisters. Roxton's role as Marguerite's modern day knight originates with his childhood and ancestral home having close proximity to Avebury, nearly twenty miles from Stonehenge. Finn would have been revealed to be Malone's great-great-granddaughter, her grandmother being the Amazon Phoebe (also played by Lara Cox) whom Malone had sex with in the episode "Amazons".[2] The series would have been resolved with Malone and Veronica together as a couple and staying in Avalon, while Challenger uses his teleportation invention from the episode "Finn" to send himself, Roxton, Marguerite, and Summerlee to London, but travels forward in time to the year 2005 where they are warmly greeted by the zoological society due to Malone having sent them a letter explaining when they would arrive.

**The Lost World of George Shrinks** (dubbed in Quebec as **Ting-Ting le lzard**) is the thirteenth episode of the third season in Canada and the twenty-ninth episode of the first season in the United States.
 
**Segment Two:** Joel turns Crow and Servo into a giant slot car set. Crow rules the road, but Servo has some major design flaws.**Segment Three:** In a Steve Allen-inspired sketch, we see what the apocalypse would be like if the Warrior of the Lost World hadn't got his driving permit yet and was forced to save the world in the back of his mom's Vista Cruiser station wagon.**Segment Four:** Joel and the Bots discuss what outrageous things they'd do after the apocalypse.
 
Sung to the tune of "Owner of a Lonely Heart" by progressive rock band Yes. The reference to *Finder of Lost Loves* is a callback to *Space Travelers*, where Crow repeatedly confused James Franciscus for Tony Franciosa.
 
In reference to the two dummies falling from the tower: Jerry Mahoney and Knucklehead Smiff were two famous dummies used by ventriloquist Paul Winchell in the 1950s and 1960s. "Oh the ventriloquy!" is most likely a riff on the famous "Oh the humanity!" line uttered by radio journalist Herbert Morrison during his eyewitness broadcast of the *Hindenburg* disaster in 1937.
 
A line sung by Elmer Fudd to the tune of Richard Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries" in the 1957 cartoon *What's Opera, Doc?*. Its use in the helicopter chase scene is a nod to *Apocalypse Now* in which a fleet of helicopters plays "Ride of the Valkyries" on loudspeaker while attacking.
 
A reference to *Every Which Way But Loose* and its sequel *Any Which Way You Can*, two comedy films starring Clint Eastwood. At the end of *Every Which Way But Loose*, Eastwood fights another man in a sequence shot with similarly jerky hand-held camera cinematography. *Warrior of the Lost World* director David Worth was also the Director of Photography for *Any Which Way You Can*.
 
Ike and Tina Turner were an R&B duo in the 60s and 70s. They were married and it later became known that Ike was physically abusive to her. The woman in the fight scene has wild hair resembling Tina's.
 
*Under the Rainbow* was a 1981 movie musical centered the Munchkin auditions for the 1938 film *The Wizard of Oz*. The cast included a large number of little person actors, including Billy Barty.
 
At the time of this episode's production, Julian Bond was known as a long-time civil rights activist who co-founded the Southern Poverty Law Center. He later served as chairman of the NAACP from 1998 to 2010.
 
Split Enz were a pop/new-wave band from New Zealand, perhaps best known in the USA for their song/video "I Got You". The band wore colorful goofy outfits, and "artsy" hair and makeup. Lead singer Tim Finn is also mentioned in passing in *The She-Creature*.
 
*Donahue* was a popular daytime TV talk show that ran from 1970-1996, hosted by Phil Donahue. It often featured sensationalist topics, including abusive relationships. Donahue has been married to Marlo Thomas since 1980.
 
We are starting with my least favorite and moving on up. Mind you, even a bad LW episode is better than a lot of what most television shows consider good so, yes, every LW episode is good for at least one viewing!
 
**\*special note\*** - Keep in mind that I am a Marguerite and Roxton shipper and although I am trying to be fair to all the LW episodes, their participation will definitely have baring on the outcome of this best-worst list.
 
**(\* # / date)** denotes if an episode has been moved up in the list and the date it was done. This can happen for any number of reasons but, for the most part, it was done because the editor changed her mind.
 
**(1) Nectar -**Not one of my favorites but notable for lovely moments when Summerlee is recalling his dead wife (w/Marguerite showing a tender side) -- and also knowing that Adama is played by Catherine Wilkin, Peter M.'s real-life wife.
 
**(1) Tribute -**Interesting footnote to Marguerite's wicked past with a German pilot but nothing to fly home about. Also, cool to see Summerlee yet again standing up to a baddy and risking death for his friends.
 
**(1) Salvation -** Interesting character development between Roxton, Marguerite and Malone. Fascinating to watch Marguerite press Malone's buttons and tell Roxton that she's "the wicked step sister". Also notable: Roxton tries valiantly to keep the peace because Summerlee and Challenger are off on their own adventure. Marguerite says the worst thing she could to Roxton (eg- William. A sore issue).
 
**(1) Unnatural Selection -**We learn Ned is still a virgin (so what was he and Veronica doing in the pond during "Blood Lust"?) and Marguerite's chosen one status is touched on yet again by a fairy queen (?).
 
**(1) Prodigal Father -**Some good moments incl
