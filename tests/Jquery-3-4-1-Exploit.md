The Exploit Database is a CVE compliant archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software, developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need actionable data right away.
 
The Google Hacking Database (GHDB) is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting, and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases, this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.
 
After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB over to OffSec in November 2010, and it is now maintained as an extension of the Exploit Database. Today, the GHDB includes searches for other online search engines such as Bing, and other online repositories like GitHub, producing different, yet equally valuable results.
 
They are currently running 11.20.85 and the version of jQuery they are still using is 2.1.3 which has known vulnerabilities. I am aware of there being another topic open for a similar, if not same, issue.

Thank you for the fast response. However, unless I am being blind (which has happened before) this does not advise anything regarding the jQuery EOL version 2.1.3 being used and how to mitigate this usage.
 
Question thread was made to the dev team who mentioned that they don't have a fix for these. As the Webconsole is being merged into the Command center over FR28 and up. Currently a large majority of webconsole reports have been moved over to the Command center.

Download Center : Targeted for FR28
My Data, Computers: Targeted for FR30

This information was brought to the customer's attention but they've seen gone dark, archiving.
 
What does this mean for us customers @Mike Struening? Are we vulnerable? Do we have to accept that we might vulnerable? Please share the risk assessment that was done that resulted in this answer to accept it and to bring back the news that it will be addressed in a new version that wille be released in the near future.
 
Automated security scanners tend to look only at library version numbers and CVE lists. Since not every function in a library is used by every application, most security audits report a lot of issues that are not actually exploitable vulnerabilities.
 
If an audit provides some evidence that a security issue is both present and exploitable in Web Console, we will review it and probably try to mitigate that issue. However, it is no longer possible for us to routinely upgrade every library deployed with the Web Console that has a CVE reported against it.
 
I understand for this case! So to summarize: we looked at it and concluded it's not exploitable and/or in use? 

The approach itself regarding deprecated features/code is somewhat to be questioned, because you basically state that we'll wait for evidence that a customer, or even worse someone from the outside was was able to exploit a known vulnerability before we fix/upgrade the related component. Doesn't feel that ok to me, especially because we are talking about a product/solution that functions as the insurance.


 
DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities usually arise when JavaScript takes data from an attacker-controllable source, such as the URL, and passes it to a sink that supports dynamic code execution, such as eval() or innerHTML. This enables attackers to execute malicious JavaScript, which typically allows them to hijack other users' accounts.
 
The most common source for DOM XSS is the URL, which is typically accessed with the window.location object. An attacker can construct a link to send a victim to a vulnerable page with a payload in the query string and fragment portions of the URL. In certain circumstances, such as when targeting a 404 page or a website running PHP, the payload can also be placed in the path.
 
The majority of DOM XSS vulnerabilities can be found quickly and reliably using Burp Suite's web vulnerability scanner. To test for DOM-based cross-site scripting manually, you generally need to use a browser with developer tools, such as Chrome. You need to work through each available source in turn, and test each one individually.
 
To test for DOM XSS in an HTML sink, place a random alphanumeric string into the source (such as location.search), then use developer tools to inspect the HTML and find where your string appears. Note that the browser's "View source" option won't work for DOM XSS testing because it doesn't take account of changes that have been performed in the HTML by JavaScript. In Chrome's developer tools, you can use Control+F (or Command+F on MacOS) to search the DOM for your string.
 
For each location where your string appears within the DOM, you need to identify the context. Based on this context, you need to refine your input to see how it is processed. For example, if your string appears within a double-quoted attribute then try to inject double quotes in your string to see if you can break out of the attribute.
 
Note that browsers behave differently with regards to URL-encoding, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari will URL-encode location.search and location.hash, while IE11 and Microsoft Edge (pre-Chromium) will not URL-encode these sources. If your data gets URL-encoded before being processed, then an XSS attack is unlikely to work.
 
Testing JavaScript execution sinks for DOM-based XSS is a little harder. With these sinks, your input doesn't necessarily appear anywhere within the DOM, so you can't search for it. Instead you'll need to use the JavaScript debugger to determine whether and how your input is sent to a sink.
 
For each potential source, such as location, you first need to find cases within the page's JavaScript code where the source is being referenced. In Chrome's developer tools, you can use Control+Shift+F (or Command+Alt+F on MacOS) to search all the page's JavaScript code for the source.
 
Once you've found where the source is being read, you can use the JavaScript debugger to add a break point and follow how the source's value is used. You might find that the source gets assigned to other variables. If this is the case, you'll need to use the search function again to track these variables and see if they're passed to a sink. When you find a sink that is being assigned data that originated from the source, you can use the debugger to inspect the value by hovering over the variable to show its value before it is sent to the sink. Then, as with HTML sinks, you need to refine your input to see if you can deliver a successful XSS attack.
 
Identifying and exploiting DOM XSS in the wild can be a tedious process, often requiring you to manually trawl through complex, minified JavaScript. If you use Burp's browser, however, you can take advantage of its built-in DOM Invader extension, which does a lot of the hard work for you.
 
In principle, a website is vulnerable to DOM-based cross-site scripting if there is an executable path via which data can propagate from source to sink. In practice, different sources and sinks have differing properties and behavior that can affect exploitability, and determine what techniques are necessary. Additionally, the website's scripts might perform validation or other processing of data that must be accommodated when attempting to exploit a vulnerability. There are a variety of sinks that are relevant to DOM-based vulnerabilities. Please refer to the list below for details.
 
Note, however, that in some situations the content that is written to document.write includes some surrounding context that you need to take account of in your exploit. For example, you might need to close some existing elements before using your JavaScript payload.
 
The innerHTML sink doesn't accept script elements on any modern browser, nor will svg onload events fire. This means you will need to use alternative elements like img or iframe. Event handlers such as onload and onerror can be used in conjunction with these elements. For example:
 
Modern web applications are typically built using a number of third-party libraries and frameworks, which often provide additional functions and capabilities for developers. It's important to remember that some of these are also potential sources and sinks for DOM XSS.
 
If a JavaScript library such as jQuery is being used, look out for sinks that can alter DOM elements on the page. For instance, jQuery's attr() function can change the attributes of DOM elements. If data is read from a user-controlled source like the URL, then passed to the attr() function, then it may be possible to manipulate the value sent to cause XSS. For example, here we have some JavaScript that changes an anchor element's href attribute using data from the URL:
 
You can exploit this by modifying the URL so that the location.search source contains a malicious JavaScript URL. After the page's JavaScript applies this malicious URL to the back link's href, clicking on the back link will execute it:
 
jQuery used to be extreme
