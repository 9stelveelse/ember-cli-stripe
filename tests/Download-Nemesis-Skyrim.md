What really makes both worth mention though is the nemesis system that turns procedurally generated baddies into your own personal antagonists the more you encounter them. Why haven't more developers tried their own take on the nemesis system in the last six years? Because Warner Bros. patented it, turns out. That sucks.
 
In my experience, you can't hardly mention Shadow Of Mordor (or War) without the conversation immediately turning to its nemesis system. Shadow Of Mordor creates Orc captains with names and combat abilities and quirks who you can hunt down and kill. If you do, another Orc with their own abilities will likely take their place. If you fail, your nemesis is likely to get promoted, gain new abilities, and then reference your shameful defeat at their hands when they hunt you down for a rematch. Even when you aren't looking, Orcs can defeat one another to climb the baddie corporate ladder. It's a neat, reactive system that invents its own stories just as often as it gives you fodder to tell your own.

Inevitably, any conversation about the nemesis system turns into imagining what other series could do with it. Seriously, imagine a Yakuza series nemesis system. They've already got the corproate hierarchy. How great would that be?
 
Talk about the nemesis system has resurfaced this week thanks to a new episode of Game Maker's Toolkit (up above, for more on why it's so great) which points out that Warner Bros. applied for a patent on the system back in 2015. So far as I can tell, it's an application that hasn't officially been granted a patent number, but it seems the chilling effect on developers who might want to tinker with a similar system is the same.
 
Monolith put down some really intersting groundwork in their Middle-Earth games but the system has it's shortcomings too. The nemesis system really deserves to be perfected, but it seems unlikely that other developers will give it a shot if they risk a tussle with the Bros. and their lawyers for it.
 
In fairness, WB aren't the only company patenting game systems. BioWare have patented their dialogue wheel. Take-Two recently filed for a patent by Rockstar developers relating to AI navigation. As far as systems I really want to see more of though, the nemesis system is one that's a real bummer to see potentially locked up.
 
The mod also removes death from the game. Instead, players are knocked out and respawn elsewhere on the map with more than a sore head - players are also given a random debuff that can only be removed by defeating a nemesis.
 
Modder Syclonix revealed in a Reddit post that they had spent the last few months working on a Skyrim mod to incorporate Shadow of Mordor's famous Nemesis system into the massively popular RPG. Titled "Shadow of Skyrim," the mod incorporates the Nemesis system, which allows certain enemies to improve or change depending on their interactions with the player. If a specific enemy manages to kill you, it gets a name, buffs, and increased stats and recognizes you if you reencounter them. It essentially adds personality to random enemies and gives the player a debuff until they defeat the enemy.

Other features of the mod include the ability for enemies to take the player's gear and use it after defeating them, a quest marker for players to find their enemy after being defeated and the ability to respawn instead of dying and waiting for the loading screen. Other fun aspects include a more dimensional interaction with the nemesis that includes "special flavour text" to create more unique interactions. Syclonix stated they have the majority of the major systems in place, and now it is just a matter of "polishing the framework" before they begin "fleshing out the content," such as nemesis titles and buffs/debuffs.
 
Syclonix confirmed the Nemesis system works on creatures as well as humanoid enemies, including Skyim's iconic dragons. They also explained some of their failsafe, such as ensuring players aren't stuck with a debuff should someone or something else kill their nemesis before they can reach them. In that case, the player gets a notification that they failed the mission and the debuff is removed automatically.
 
In responding to fan enthusiasm, Syclonix replied, "I'm glad people are so excited by this mod in development. It's really encouraging after working on it under wraps for months." They also admitted to being nervous about the release, as several fans commented on how the mod could prove to be one of the greatest of all time should it work as hoped. "I'm so nervous about the release, I've been working on it for so long and I hope people like it," they said. Shadow of Mordor is considered by many to be the greatest Lord of the Rings game of all time, and its Nemesis system is a significant reason why.
 
Given the game's age, Skyrim is the receptor of several mods aimed at keeping the game interesting for new and veteran players. Mods are so commonplace for the game that many consider modders vital to Skyrim's continuation as graphics and gameplay grow increasingly higher in quality. While some mods prove to be intentionally silly, such as one that allows players to glide around Skyrim with a paraglider, others breathe new life into a game that players continue to come back to despite newer RPGs such as Elden Ring and The Witcher 3.
