At this point in the summer, be alert to the possibility of haemonchosis in grazing sheep and goats, particularly after heavy rains. This tropical/subtropical parasite is better able to survive in warmer temperatures in contrast to our more usual gastro-intestinal parasites e.g. Teladorsagia circumcincta. Clinical signs are anaemia and sub-cutaneous oedema (bottle jaw). Diarrhoea is not a feature where Haemonchus contortus predominates in the host. There is little immunity to this parasite, so disease can be seen in lambs and adults. APHA Veterinary Investigation Centre Carmarthen can carry out differential staining on trichostrongyle-type eggs to detect haemonchus sp. eggs (TC0777).
