Waitlist Me not only replaces pen and paper (or those weird flashing restaurant buzzers) but it creates more transparency around how long it will take for customers to be seated. Customers get a text notification when they are added to a waitlist and can check in to see how many parties are ahead of them and what their estimated wait time is from their phones.

Spaces for garages with a waitlist are filled only as permit holders leave. Spaces usually become available each month but the number of spaces that open up is unpredictable. For this reason, the wait will likely be a minimum of three months and possibly longer.
 
Your name will remain active until a space becomes available, you cancel your waitlist request, or upon waitlist expiration. R and S permit waitlists expire at the beginning of the next semester's open sales. We call off the waitlist on a regular basis and request your patience, as we will eventually get to your name.
 
Once a space becomes available, you will receive a time-sensitive email offer and you will have the chance to accept or decline. If you do not respond by the date listed with each offer, your name will be removed from the waitlist and the space will be offered to the next person on the list. If you are given a higher priority offer, you will automatically be removed from the lower priority request.
 
Please be aware that as a condition of having multiple list selections, when your name comes up for one of your waitlist choices, and you decline the offer, your name will automatically drop from all waitlist choices.

Managing a waitlist is complicated, Roberts said, because you need to have people who want the vaccine and have both the transportation and flexibility to get to the vaccine clinic within about 30 minutes, but so far it has worked out.
 
Waitlists are available on most course sections. Placing yourself on a waitlist allows you to reserve a place in line for the next available seat in the section. When a seat opens (due to another student dropping the course), the first student on the waitlist will be eligible to register in the section.
 
\*IMPORTANT NOTE: Waitlist enrollment will be closed from 6 to 9 p.m. each semester on the payment deadline and will reopen at 9 p.m. that evening. (The last day to add your name to a waitlist is the payment deadline, see academic calendar for payment deadlines). All waitlist reservations will be deleted the following day at 9 p.m. If an email notification is received during this time, the 24-hour timeframe to enroll in the class will not apply and students may have a much shorter timeframe to enroll.
 
I need help here. Multiple customers have asked to be removed from waitlist because they weregetting spammed with notifications. Right now, I'm also having trouble finding a customer's name on the waitlist. They forwarded me the email they received regarding their waitlist status, and I was able to find the customer record but can't find them on the actual waitlist.

Please allow customers to remove themselves from the waitlist, add a search by name feature in the waitlist section, or even add waitlist information under client information.
 
This has not been fixed yet. On top of that, I have some customers who continue to receive notifications about openings after having secured a spot from waitlist so they end up opting out of email and text entirely.

I have done a landing page in shopify and also created a waitlist sign up form in Klaviyo. How do I embed the code (not sure where to find this either) on the landing page email sign up section, to direct the customer to the waitlist form?
 
If a course is full when a student registers, the waitlist/hold file option may be available. Most, but not all courses, offer a waitlist/hold file. Student names are saved to the waitlist/hold file on a first-come, first-served basis and based on the day and time a student confirms placement on the waitlist/hold file. Students will be given a seat in a section if a seat becomes available. **Students must process a** **Waitlist Check-in** **to officially confirm registration for the course and section.**
 
The waitlist is an option if you meet the established course requirements (specific majors, credit levels, special populations, etc.)

The hold file is a roster of students who wish to register for a course, but who do not meet the course restrictions. These students must be placed on the hold file even though the course may have seats available. At the beginning of the semester, students on the hold file will be placed at the end of the waitlist. Students must then follow the established procedure for waitlist check-in.
 
When you attempt to register for a course (either on Testudo Registration (Drop/Add) or in-person) and the course does not have an available seat, you will have the option to place yourself on the waitlist or hold file, if one is available. You must enter a course and section to add yourself to the waitlist/hold file.

For instructions on how to add yourself to the waitlist, follow this video tutorial.
 
To remain on the waitlist you must check-in once a day, either through Testudo or in-person, during the mandatory waitlist check-in period available on the dates and deadlines page. Students that do not check-in will be removed from the waitlist. If a section has already been assigned, it will be given to the next eligible student.
 
It is strongly recommended that you attend all sessions held for a waitlisted course if space permits. By doing so, you are able to keep up with the course material. If you are in the top five (5) positions on a waitlist, you will be given access to the course content in ELMS.
 
No, to be eligible for the waitlist/hold file you cannot be registered for any other section of the desired course. If you are currently registered for any other section of the course, you must drop that section before you can be placed on the waitlist. If you register for an open section of the same course for which you are already waitlisted, you will be removed from the waitlists.
 
You may select up to six (6) sections of a course. The first section to become available will automatically be assigned to you. Since you will now be registered for a section, your name will be removed from the waitlist for any additional sections of that course. If you subsequently refuse the assigned section, it will be given to the next person on the waitlist. Then you may attempt to register again and be placed on the waitlist at the end of the list.
 
You are encouraged to select a section that fits your schedule unless you plan to drop any course that conflicts with the waitlisted section if it is received.

If you do not drop the course that conflicts, you will be notified to resolve the issue in a timely manner or you will be administratively dropped from the course you received from the waitlist.
 
The system identifies the issue when students receive the course, and the issue does not update based on any action. The message can only be removed when a waitlist balance is run, generally weekly. In some cases, if students are waitlisted for other courses and checking-in daily, this message will not go away. As long as a student has taken appropriate action to resolve the issue, the student will not be dropped from the course received from the waitlist.
 
If new sections are opened with exact meeting times of any of your waitlisted sections, you will be automatically confirmed into the new section. You can then process a Waitlist Check-in to officially confirm your registration.
 
Students are required to process a Waitlist Check-in once per day during the schedule adjustment period as outlined on the dates and deadlines page. If you receive a seat on the last day of the schedule adjustment period, you can check-in the day after the schedule adjustment period to officially confirm your registration.
 
A registration waitlist is an electronic list of students who are waiting to register for a full class. Students may sign up when they attempt to register for a section at full capacity. The first student on the registration waitlist is notified via email (and via text message IF the student has requested this feature) when a space becomes available. This student then has 24 hours to register for the section. If the student does not register for the section within the 24 hour timeframe, they will be dropped from the Registration Waitlist for that section and the next student on the list will be notified.
 
You can ask the instructor or department for an override for enrollment capacity. If they cannot give one, keep checking to see if a space becomes available on the registration waitlist. However, being on the registration waitlist does not guarantee you will get in the class.
 
You will have **until the deadline noted on the email** to register for the section, which is 24 hours from the time the email was sent. If you do not register within that time frame, you will be dropped from the registration waitlist. If you miss your registration window but still wish to register for the class, you may register for the registration waitlist again.
 
This means an override was given for Enrollment Capacity by the department or the instructor of the section, and the student with the override was able to register before you did. Contact the academic department offering the course as soon as possible.
 
The only way someone can register for a full section while people are on the registration waitlist is to get an Enrollment Capac
