We are also not handling the payments, it's still Medicard, we are just helping to facilitate. For feedback about payments and requests to allow reimbursements for face to face consults, please direct it to Medicard. If you want to get accredited, please scroll to the end of this article.*

**Update March 21, 2021**: We're now starting with **Phase 2 of the MediCard integration**. We will update this article as we start releasing the updates. Phase 2, once fully rolled out will help you get verified as a MediCard doctor, verify LOAs, let's you accept face to face LOA's and lets your patient request for an LOA inside NowServing.
 
We think so too. We'd definitely want to eventually integrate that so patients won't need to enter their LOA code anymore and validity is also automatically checked but you know how these things work. It takes time. Let's make this a big success and let them know about it so Medicard would consider direct LOA integration soon.

Payments will not go through SeriousMD. This is between you and Medicard, we are just helping facilitate this encounter. This collaboration **currently affects only online consultations**. We're still working towards being able to let your face to face HMO consults be covered as well. Let Medicard know about it if you want it so they can hear your feedback, not just ours.
 
If you do not get a response in 2 days, please send a follow up email to fmcastro@medicardphils.com and rnegrete@medicardphils.com or call the CMG trunkline 8841-8080 and inform the agent that you want to be accredited
 
As much as we'd like that this included Face to Face consults, it's not yet included so that still has to be done the "traditional" way but please let Medicard hear about it so they would want to include Face to Face as well.
 
If the patient sent a message about making a slight mistake in typing their LOA or MemberID, you can edit it while it's still in your appointment request area and the system will re-check with MediCard.
 
Unless you have an Australian passport, I doubt you can get a medicard card. My girlfriend who is Canadian went through this exercise last February and had to end up getting private health insurance here instead. She has a full 4 year work visa so as a casual traveller I doubt you would qualify.
 
There are limits of what is available through the reciprocal agreements, so check the Medicare website! It's always worthwhile checking the offical website, as other websites with information on it may become out of date and are probably not so thorough.
