Heavy vehicle maintenance technicians must be able to work with internal combustion engines and components. This entails a knowledge of a variety of specific tools such as heavy equipment and power tools to diagnose problems, make adjustments, and repair faults.
 
Work often has to be done at speed, while observing strict safety standards if vital production time is not to be lost. The technician often works alone and is the link between the employer, the customer, and the manufacturer and can involve a degree of seniority at the highest level of performance.****

With the increased use of highly sophisticated pneumatic, hydraulic, and electronic systems on heavy equipment today, successful students find many opportunities for employment. Cooperative work opportunities within the industry allow students to experience different types of jobs before graduating. In addition, please note that a student may only earn one Occupational Skills Award (OSA) per academic year.
 
Completion of a three- to five-year apprenticeship program or a combination of over four years of work experience in the trade and some high school, college or industry courses in heavy equipment repair is usually required to be eligible for trade certification.
 
Farm equipment mechanic trade certification is available, but voluntary, in Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia.
 
Many Indigenous and remote communities have mechanical knowledge, particularly when it comes to machines used to hunt. This enables people to fix machines in order to continue traditional hunting and gathering activities that sustain life. However, there may be less access to formal training on mechanical knowledge. Many fly-in communities do not have access to the types of equipment and workplace technology learn the ropes in this career. Students from these communities may need to relocate to get their education and training and may also need to travel to job sites once they get a career. However, mechanical knowledge is a highly desirable skill when it comes to life in remote communities where access to replacement parts and equipment is more limited than in other parts of the country. In communities with close proximities to mines or access to work in the mining industry, apprenticeships and on-the-job training may be available.
 
Indigenous and remote communities are catching up to southern Canada when it comes to digital technology and computer skills and industries. Not all communities have access to reliable, affordable internet and service interruptions are all too common. Access to computers at home is not a given for everyone and Elders and even sometimes younger generations lack computer knowledge, although this situation is undergoing some significant changes at the moment. But even those people in Indigenous and remote communities with interest and high-level skills in computers may not have the same access to opportunities to learn about different programs and may face significant bandwidth issues, limiting their ability to learn and develop in this field. Indigenous and remote students may need qualifying courses or need to augment college learning to be successful in this field.
 
Although with significant improvements currently underway to internet connections in Indigenous and remote communities, careers in this field become more viable and are likely to become more so in years to come.
 
As this field involves both complex thinking and analysis as well as physical operation, people with physical, intellectual and learning disabilities may need accommodations in order to be successful.
