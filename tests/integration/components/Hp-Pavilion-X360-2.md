However, this is not always the case and it was sometimes possible to simply work several hours on it. I did that regularly about a month ago. I have to admit that I leave it on the charger (especially at home) because it is annoying when it suddenly shuts down. I did a battery test and it now said it only has 26% capacity left. It could be that this is correct, but I think it is strange that I was able to work on it for hours recently. Does the battery need to be replaced or is there something else I can try? Unfortunately I no longer have a warranty on the laptop, is it useful to buy an HP care pack to get a new battery?

At first it seemed like the problem was solved and most of the time it works fine now, but it still happened once that the laptop was charged when I closed it and when I opened it, it just shut down. So I guess the problem is still not completely solved...:(
 
It's even worse now, as HP support assistent says the battery is very weak and needs to be replaced. I also got a black screen telling me this when turning the laptop on. Before the status of the battery was fine according to HP support assistent.
 
I have recently bought a brand new HP Pavilion x360 and I am needing to reset my router every time I want to connect to the network. It seemed to work fine when I was using it for a couple of days at my parents house, and it works fine after resetting the router at home, however if it left for any length of time in sleep mode or shut down it will not reconnect to my network. I can see all the networks in the area but when I try to connect it will work for literally 10 seconds and then drop again until I reset the router. I have tried updating the network driver, rolling the driver back, uninstalling and reinstalling, nothing works. I have changed the setting so that it does not turn off the adapter in sleep mode, still no difference. There seems to be a lot of others on the forums having similar issues, dating as far back as 2009 at least, and I can't find a solution in any of those threads that seems to work. Seriously, can HP PLEASE fix this issue??
 
I understand that you have an HP Pavilion x360 Convertible 14-ba1xx laptop. I read that the laptop often disconnects from the wireless network and reconnects only after you reset the router. I'll be glad to assist you with this case.
 
Every other device in the house connects fine, including phone, tablet and other laptops. It is only my HP that is disconnecting. I have not changed any software on the laptop, but as I say the laptop is brand new, I only bought it on Friday so it could be an issue with the pre-installed software.
 
I have been through the troubleshooting guide and the only thing that makes a difference is resetting the router, which appears to only be a temporary fix. All hardware and component tests seemed to indicate that everything is working correctly, but I will try rerunning it a few times throughout the day to see if it is dropping in and out.
 
It does appear to work better on other networks, seemed to be fine at my parents. Again, other devices are working fine on my home wifi, it just appears to be a problem between my laptop and my home wifi. I'm a bit limited in what I can do with the router though, as it's my flatmates
 
I uninstalled McAfee after ttrying all the steps provided below and that worked. It seem as McAfee had a Network security that will timeout like every 10 minute or so. Hope this helps. I had retured the laptop thinking it was a defect but the problem proceeded. I had a new Router installed after but that was because i had renew my internet provider contract(had nothing to do with the wifi issue though) It is working perfect, just downloaded a different virus protection app
 
**UPDATE:** The problem wasnt McAfee as i am still ones again expericancing issues with the wifi dropping on only this laptop. everything else is staying connected. I tried everything on the forum and none of it was successful. I even returned the laptop in exchange for a new one again and still nothing. I am extremely disappointed as HP has yet even recalled this issue.
 
I own an HP Pavilion x360 and I remember before I could turn the auto-rotate feature on and off, which is why I ended up getting this computer. Well, I was out of school for a while and hadn't used my laptop for a hot minute. Now that I'm in school again, I use it frequently and realized that the auto-rotate isn't there anymore. I can still turn my laptop into a table by folding it and pressing the "TABLET" button on the action center, however, when I flip my tablet mode/ flip the screen it doesn't rotate like it used to and the keyboard and mouse still work and don't deactivate during tablet mode. I've also seen that the volume button on the side does flip its controls like it used to in tablet mode.
 
I will have to eventually have to replace the laptop but not any time soon. And, I don't want to mess with the drivers and other internal "non-settings-app" (control panel, device manager) settings unless I absolutely have to, as I am not as tech-savvy as I would like to be.
 
I have tried everything that comes up on a search for the answer, and nothing works. I would like my auto-rotate back, and the ability to turn into a tablet without pressing for it. I will provide extra information about the laptop if needed!
 
The Intel Integrated Sensor Solution Driver enables the Accelerometer, Gyroscope, and eCompass sensors that provide rotation control functionality typically used in detachable and convertible system. This package is provided for supported models running a supported operating system.
 
This is that whenever I turn on my laptop, the keyboard is completely disabled, as if I have the laptop flipped over like a tablet, even if it's not. For the first little while I would find that it would fix itself suddenly, but that slowly stopped happening and now it is stuck this way. It seems to be a software problem, not a hardware one.
 
If your keyboard is not working:
Turn off the computer and then restart it.
Press the Esc key repeatedly to see if a startup menu opens.
If a setup menu does not open, the integrated keyboard hardware is not working. The integrated keyboard in the notebook should be serviced or replaced. To continue using the notebook, connect a USB-wired keyboard to a USB port and restart the computer.
If a setup menu opens, use the arrow keys to navigate the menus. If these keys are working in the startup menu, but then fail when Windows loads, the problems might be related to the keyboard software.
Restart the computer.
In Device Manager, uninstall and reinstall the keyboard software:
In Windows, search for and open Device Manager.
Click View and select Show Hidden Devices.
Click the arrow next to Keyboards, right-click the keyboard device name, then select Uninstall to remove the device from Windows.
Continue removing device names in the Keyboards category until all device names have been uninstalled.
Restart the notebook. Right-click Start (), select Shut down or sign out, then select Restart.
Wait for the computer to restart and open Windows.
The keyboard should now work correctly. To test the keyboard for key or hardware failures, see Testing for Hardware Failures (Windows 10, 8).
 
I have not made any hardware changes since I have purchased my device. I have installed software, however none of them should have an impact on the keyboard, and they are all trusted applications.
 
I also ran the component hardware test for both the keyboard and tocuhpad, the one that appears when pressing f2 when booing up. They showed no errors, and the keyboard and touchpad were working fine.
