Once you checkout with varifocal lenses we will send you your choice of frame. We then require that you have a photograph taken of you wearing this new frame.

This may mean you need to have separate glasses for separate things... For example one pair for seeing far away while you're driving and one pair for close up tasks such as reading. People under 40 mostly opt for this style of lens as they're more likely to have just one prescription.
 
For example, this means if you are using a cash machine you would be able to view the keys, screen, your card and then continue to walk down the street.\nAny distance vision you need can be seen by moving your eyes between these points on the lens. At Pretavoir, we use Digital Analysis to find your unique measurements. This allows our experts to see exactly where to position the lens within your frame for maximum visual performance.
