The MPC Beats Academy is your destination to learn the MPC workflow from start to finish. From making your first beat, to mixing and finalizing, down to exporting and sharing your music, the MPC Beats Academy will guideyou through your music making journey on MPC Beats.
 
I tested MPC Beats for a month, using it as my main software for capturing new melodies and other musical ideas. It performed amazingly well as a beat making sketch pad, although I still felt like I needed my main DAW to complete the production.
 
It lacks some of the features available in its premium counterpart, but all of the core functionality is included. You can use Waveform Free to record, mix, and master your music beat from the ground up.

Cakewalk by BandLab is another DAW that beatmakers should not overlook. Its conventional sequencing workflow becomes particularly advantageous when recording vocals or tangible instruments via a microphone. 

Since the late 1980s, Cakewalk has been a steadfast presence in the music production software realm, debuting its first version in 1987. This longevity naturally leads to a well-refined, feature-rich music making tool. It shares most features with industry-standard music creation tools like Cubase, Logic Pro, and Pro Tools.
 
LMMS stands as an entirely free, open-source platform for beat creation. It replicates the efficient workflow of one of the most popular beat maker tools in existence, FL Studio.

For most beatmakers, the standout feature of LMMS is its sequencing workflow, deeply rooted in the methodologies of pioneering beat-making programs like Fruity Loops and Reason. This intuitive loop-based approach provides a streamlined environment for beat creation, unlike traditional sequencer layouts found in other digital audio workstations.
 
With that in mind, LMMS is a robust free beat maker tool for crafting beats and jamming with your favorite drum samples and virtual instruments.

The capabilities of LMMS can be extended further with third-party VST plugins. You can load drum machines, samplers, and effects to add variety to your music production software arsenal.
 
I tested the latest version of LMMS for Windows, and it performed well. The application itself is relatively lightweight compared to other beat making apps on this list, and there were no stability issues.
 
GarageBand is a freebie that comes with every Mac, yet it rivals many professional DAWs in terms of intuitiveness. With its easy-to-use interface, GarageBand is the perfect launchpad for aspiring beat makers who want to create music with a tight budget.
 
Magix distinguishes itself from other free beat making software programs by offering a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface. This allows novices to start making music and creating beats in just a few clicks.
 
Despite its drawbacks, Magix Music Maker is a cost-effective piece of software for emerging music producers interested in making beats for free. It is the best tool to try if you want to learn beat making before moving to a professional DAW.
 
Conversely, the lack of advanced MIDI editing features might be a minor bump in the road for advanced beat makers. Yes, you can edit MIDI in Soundbridge, but not on the same level as in professional DAWs.
 
The user interface provides the standard elements expected in a DAW, such as audio and MIDI tracks, virtual instruments, and effects. One distinct feature of Amped Studio is its hybrid track functionality, which enables the integration of audio and MIDI on the same track.
 
While Amped Studio offers a free version, several features are only accessible via a subscription. These premium features include additional virtual instruments and effects, extended sound libraries, and the ability to export projects in high-quality formats. The cloud storage capacity for saving projects online is also increased with a subscription.
 
Soundtrap is another cloud-based app for music making and podcast creation. It was developed by Spotify, and offers real-time collaboration, allowing multiple users to work on projects concurrently from different locations.
 
The free version offers unlimited projects, 5040 loops, 290 one-shots, 440 instruments, and sounds, with access to 150,000 sound effects from freesound.org. Additionally, there is limited access to new sound packs, which are released every two weeks.
 
However, the free version of Soundtrap has serious limitations. To access premium features such as high-quality audio exports, pitch correction, and a wider range of loops and sounds, a paid subscription is required.
 
Soundtrap is a versatile cloud-based beat making app with all the core features necessary for basic music composition. While its free edition offers a decent starting point, a subscription is necessary to unlock its full capabilities.
 
All free beat making programs have some limitations, but you can still use them as your main digital audio workstation. Refer to our list of free beat making apps to find the one which provides all the functionality needed for your workflow.
 
Seasoned beat makers should consider using Waveform Free or Cakewalk by Bandlab as their main platform. Both programs offer advanced functionality for recording and editing audio, MIDI, and automation.
 
As you can see in this article, there are many great free beat-making tools on the market. The best way to become a beat maker on a budget is to download one of these free apps and use the software to practice and improve your skills.
 
Another option to consider is making apps for mobile phones and tablets. There are numerous beat creation tools for the iPad and iPhone, and you can easily carry them around in your backpack or pocket.
