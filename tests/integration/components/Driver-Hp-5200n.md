So, I've done it. I was able to get latest driver on a system now, but unfortunately it is still not the one that Adobe likes. I've tried again to install the one that Adobe suggests (27.20.100.8476) but then I got the message that the comupter doesn't meet minimum requirements. Obviously I'll have to live with lagging AE or buy myself a new comp. Nevertheless I've learn something new and thank you for your help.

I'm not an expert in widows, but since you have a better GPU Geforce GTX, AE should only use the GTX mostly the system should switch automatically, anyway if you running on a desktop you disable the intel graphic I think and use the pro GPU only
 
I've selected prefferred graphics processor in Nvidia settings for AF, but I still get the message at start up. And the AF is still very, very slow. I can't disable Intel graphic in BIOS in my desktop, there is no option. There is a problem with a driver. Since I cant force windows to install the Intel driver that Adobe recommends I found this "hack"
 
Manually remove the card from device manager with the option to actually delete the drivers, then have Windows automatically reinstate it. After that, go to the device manager again and let it check for updated drivers. You may need to boot into safe mode to do all this, if your driver is busted, as it appears from your description.
 
If I delete graphic card and driver from the system, how do I get it back on the system again - you said -have windows automatically reinstate it. How? Sorry, I just don't wan't to screw up everything.
 
Right-click on the computer icon at the top in device manager and select "Scan for new hardware". no worries. You can pretty much not screw this up. Latest on one of the next reboots Windows would automatically notice that there is an unregistered device and scan for a driver.
 
I know this is an older thread but just as I stumbled upon it looking for an answer so will someone else. The anser is that you have to go into your Nvidia Control Panel then in Manage 3D settings click the Program Settings tab. Click the ADD button and search for After Effects then select the High Performance NVIDIA Processor. Then your After Effects should load and run with less lag and hopefully no issues as long as you have the recommended hardware.

We have a HP Laserjet 5200 that I ran the Firmware update utility on to update the firmware to the lastest version 20150803 08.280.2 and ever since I updated the firmware each night the printer gets a error "49.4200 ERROR Turn off then on". Which once you turn off and bck on then on it works fine all day long, then at sometiem during the night the error comes back. I've verified nothing is in the que, I've deleted the printer from the print server and re-installed. I 've updated to the latest drivers on the print server, I've tried both PLC5 and PLC6 as well as the generic driver. Still get the error every morning. I've also update the drivers on each of the workstations that are connected to it which I don't think is causing the error becuase all day the printer works fine but something tries to communicate with it or the printer maybe does a self check at somepoint duing the night. We have 5 - HP 5200n laserprinters and each one has this error in the morning. I've tried re-installing the firmware both with the easy update utility as well as ftp into the printer, nothing works. Any ideas on what else to test or any idea where I can get a older version of the firmware? The printers all worked fine before the update. The reason why I ran the update is becuase one of the printers had a 49.4c error and that errors fix was to update to the latest firmware and not thinking I pushed out the update to all of our 5200! Bad move. Anyway any ideas or help would be appreciated. Thanks!
 
One way to confirm would be to setup a network trace on one of your 5200's. Review the network communication along with any timestamps that you can find to suggest when the error occurs. Widdle down possible causes from there.
 
One possible work around would be to set up a light timer to reboot the printer during off hours automatically. I believe other tools like WebJet Admin can do this for you manually and may have automatic options too. Some clever scripting may lead you to a solution over telnet that enables you to reboot the printers from a scheduled task on your print server.
 
As far as downgrading the firmware goes you would need to get your hands on the old firmware somehow. HP doesnt publish the old versions on the support website. Then you have to consider if your model allows for downgrades or not. Only the newest models install firmware on teh local hard drive making it easier to reset firmware. The majority of older printers have firmware build into the formatter making it often impossible to downgrade without purchasing a new formatter.
 
I'll give this a try and see if it works. I have tried the UPD but not this version. Question when you fixed your problem did you install the drivers on the print server and the workstations or was yours a standalone printer?
 
We have been encountering Paper Jam (13.20.00 Jam in Top Cover Area) problem for the HP LaserJet 5200n model for some time, printing from both Tray 1 and Tray 2 show the same Paper Jam 13.20.00 error result, we would appreciate if you could provide some input on the matter.
 
However same results on the paper jam. We did not test the Tray 2 Pick up Roller as the replacement part itself was faulty. (The notch part was not secure, making the entire removable part to wobble and not clip straight.)
 
2) Prior to replacing the parts, we took out the Fuser via YouTube instructions =ing3Bw3unjY to have a look and see if we could find any irregularities. We read at discussion forums stating that some sensors triggered the paper jams, after removing the Fuser, we were unsure of the locations of the sensors and unsure of what we were looking at.
 
We have a hunch over some components that may have possibly been misaligned/been affected while we removed and reinstalled the Fuser, however we are as well unsure on this matter and unsure what to look out for.
 
Hello updateme\_hp,

To get your issue more exposure I would suggest posting it in the commercial forums since the HP LaserJet 5200n is a commercial product. You can do this at HP Enterprise Business Community.

The support page for your product may be helpful in the meantime:
HP Support Center.
 
Turns out this issue was indeed caused by the paper tray size not set correctly - this even caused a strange issue with the duplexer making a grinding noise when the machine was turned on initially. We were running 8x11 paper in tray 3 as "letter" (we were running short side first - causing jams) which is actually supposed to be fed long side first, letter (r) is paper coming out short side first. I had blown out sensors, tried replacing registration assy, checking fuser assy and sensor (looked ok) and verifying solenoid pads were all ok. Only after setting the paper as described on the tray 3 front (open the tray and instructions are on the top left side) - pay VERY close attention on how the paper should be oriented in the tray and the EXACT position the dial for the tray should be on. This solved my issue - paper feeding and duplexing properly and duplexer not making grinding noise... Hope it helps someone else.

Recommendation: If you are inexperienced with updating HP Printer device drivers, we highly recommend downloading the DriverDoc driver update tool [Download DriverDoc - Product by Solvusoft]. DriverDoc takes away all of the hassle and headaches of updating your LaserJet 5200n drivers by downloading and updating them automatically.
 
It is often hard to find a right solution to a LaserJet 5200n hardware-related error by visiting HP (Hewlett Packard)'s website. Even if you have the expertise, finding, downloading, and updating LaserJet 5200n drivers can still be a tedious and messy process. Inaccurate driver versions may have an adverse impact on your computer's performance, often creating more problems.
 
Using a driver updating program can allow drivers to update without difficulty, so we An update program not only provides the right drivers that are compatible with your hardware, but it also guarantees that there is a backup of current drivers before any changes are made. Using a backup driver system helps you to rollback any driver to the previous version if a problem arises.
 
For basic printing functionality use the Postscript PPD. For advanced functionality such as printer status and maintenance features, use the HPLIP driver (which includes HPIJS). PostScript L3, PCL5, PCL6, HP-GL/2 48 MB std, depending on flavour. Optional accessories are duplexer, 500 sheet tray, hard drive, extra memory, ethernet adapter Consumables/Refills: Toner and drum in one cartridge (10000 pages)
