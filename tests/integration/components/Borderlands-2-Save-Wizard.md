A guy on youtube told me he used a save made with save wizard to unlock few things in a game, I didn't have any idea about what was savewizard, so I searched it up and read that you can also unlock trophies, for example, with a save that has everything you need for the plat. My question is: will you get banned if, for example, you use this save wizard to unlock trophies that are no more unlockable? For example a trophy that requires to play community events, but community events ended for this game?
 
I want to put the hands forward and say that I would never buy SaveWizard because it seems to cost a lot so I think I'll never get the plat for that game ?, I was just wondering what would happen because usually cheats leads to account ban but I see a good number of ppl is using this thing

However, I wouldn't recommend doing it for several reasons, but the main reason would be because using save wizard would literally make that trophy pointless. There's no victory, fun, or sportsmanship in using save wizard at all. Only a cheap copout to increase you completion %.
 
But honestly, its a few trophies you won't have. Like @Beyondthegrave07 said, if you use anSave Wizard for them, it takes away the fun, challenge and overall accomplishment that comes with succeeding at something difficult.
 
you could technically get away with it if you used it to pop trophies on the sly and made it look like you achieved them for real and at the correct times, for example if you had one left for the plat and wasn't skilled enough to get it yourself but like others said it takes the fun away from trophy hunting and you yourself would know
 
While I have not used it myself this is what it does, not the trophy itself just the stats needed for the trophy. Maxing things like the poster above said such as the studies in RDR2 and since they are needed for a trophy it causes the trophy to pop.
 
I never tried this, I don't think it's worth the risk or effort. It's just a game and it's not like trophies give you money or anything to warrant such desperate measures. If I get stuck on a game or trophy/trophies, I usually just leave it if I fail to get it after multiple tries and move on in the game or onto another game. You can technically increase your completion percentage anyway by platinuming more games, although it probably takes longer than going back to previous games
 
can you use savewizard in a completed game without penalties in the leaderboards? (like if you wanna unlock a weapon that's super rare to drop but its not necessary for trophies cause you already got the platinum the legit way)?
 
How would you even get banned from PSN, literally no way to report it. There's people with 1000s of hacked games that never get banned. As far as i can tell Sony really don't care about stuff like this.

To answer OP's question, its incredibly unlikely that you'll be banned from PSN, but you'll be kicked off the leaderboards here (and probably on other sites too). If you find it fun and don't care for leaderboards, then its none of my business what you do (though I wouldnt recommend it anyway because it takes away all the fun!)
