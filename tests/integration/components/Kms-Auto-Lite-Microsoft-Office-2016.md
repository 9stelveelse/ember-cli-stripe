My company currently blocks Microsoft Auto Update via Restricted Software tab in JAMF Pro. I've been tasked with finding a way to create an exception so that Defender gets updated on all of our macs while MS auto update is still in place. Has anyone had any experience with this in the past?
 
@mauricemoss Any specific reason you don't want your Office apps to update? Microsoft does now offer deferred update channels so you can delay updates to your users until you've had a chance to qualify them: -now-provides-curated-deferral-channels-for-autoupdate/
 
Hi @McAwesome , If we deploy office package with team, then do we need to deploy any configuration profile to get MS Office apps auto updated those will get updated automatically without any additional profile or policy pl?
 
I'm also curious why Microsoft Auto Update is being blocked, but, assuming for a moment there's a valid and justifiable reason for this, my next question is, how specifically is it being blocked using Restricted Software? Are you just blocking the "Microsoft AutoUpdate" executable? If so, inside the same app bundle where that lives is "msupdate" which is the command line binary that allows you to update most Microsoft apps using a script. I've never tested this, but I believe as long as you aren't also blocking that binary, you might be able to use it in a script to keep certain Microsoft apps up to date, and still stop the AutoUpdate application from being used.
 
Sure, I can believe that. However, it might still be worth exploring for the OP, if there really isn't an option to just allow the AutoUpdate application to do it's thing. It sounds like they only want to let Defender update regularly and have more control over the other apps.

2. The use a Citrix client to connect to a website and download some templates in .xlsx format. The file downloads but cannot open. The XG reports the website domain-virus under blocked web attempts (see snapshot)
 
On the second issue, the client is using citrix retriever to connect to etelmar site. The reports from this site are .xlsx format and have extensions. The files are downloading but they cannot open and give an error about the extension. If I connect to the same site on another router, the file downloads OK and can open. I noticed that download of the file through the sophos XG125, the file size is smaller. Any one seen this and knows what is happening?
 
Why in the world has this not been addressed in a patch? We spent quite some time manually installing office and doing windows updates on a new laptop because of this issue. All because a url is missing from an exception policy? We've been using the XG for several months now and I've never had so many issues with a firewall.
 
I couldnt agree more. Why cant we have a switch we flip on the XG that allows all microsoft and 365 related apps communicate without an issue? Whenever I have to install 365 I have to disable web scanning to perform that actions. I have entered dozens of exceptions without anything changing.

That tenant could be Microsoft Corp., which is considering relocating at least some of its Southfield offices into one of the downtown buildings owned by Gilbert's Bedrock Detroit, according to a source familiar with the negotiations between the two firms. The Redmond, Wash.-based technology firm currently occupies 52,000 square feet at the Southfield Town Center, one the largest multi-tenant office complexes in Michigan. Microsoft is considering leasing around 50,000 square feet in downtown Detroit, according to the source.
 
He hinted at the plans during an interview with Bloomberg News anchor Betty Liu on Sunday afternoon at the North American International Auto Show. Gilbert used the stage to pitch the city to out-of-town journalists and auto company employees, and encourage visitors to get out and see the changes happening downtown.
 
The businessman moved the headquarters of Quicken Loans from Livonia to downtown Detroit in 2010. At the time, the city's central business district was struggling with blight. Since the move, over 30 of those buildings have been renovated and become occupied, are being fixed up, or have plans to be brought back to life.
 
Gilbert-affiliated companies are responsible for a number of restaurants and renovated apartment buildings downtown. Bedrock recently completed work on the first ground-up construction project in the Central Business District since the 1980s. The 28 Grand project, located not far from Cobo Center where Gilbert spoke Sunday afternoon, houses 218 "micro" apartments, a catchy term used to describe the 260-square-foot rooms.
 
The businessman also has two major mixed-use development projects on the back burner. One is a mixed-use building on the site of the former J.L. Hudson's Building, details of which Gilbert and his associates have kept under wraps for over a year. Plans for that project are pending city approval. The other project is a multi-block renovation on a site in the heart of downtown known as the Monroe Block, where Gilbert wants to build an office tower and a residential tower in addition to retail space.
 
On Sunday, Gilbert teased a major announcement within the next few weeks. He also said by next year there should be construction cranes on the skyline, equipment Gilbert for months has said indicates proper growth in a major city.
 
The Detroit-based businessman said the city's success depends on the growth of its major companies, namely Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. The Big Three has already been instrumental in helping the city rebuild, he said.
 
"They've been great," he said. "If you walk within a half a mile ... on any of the streets here, you're going to see things that you've never seen before, and a lot of that was because of cooperation from General Motors, and Ford and Chrysler."
 
Taking the conversation national, Gilbert offered a few remarks regarding President-elect Donald Trump. Gilbert said he's met Trump, who he called "the least predictable person," a couple times. Gilbert said he wasn't sure how Trump's policies might affect Detroit or the auto industry, but said Trump's history as a businessman and real estate magnate could lead to benefits for major cities with "urban cores," a term Gilbert uses to refer to downtown areas he sees as essential to the strength of a city.
