If this is a large environment then the answer is most likely datacentre - as you can run unlimited windows OSEs and therefore move them between hosts etc. if you go for standard you cannot move the vm without SA etc plus when you add a vm you will need more licenses.
 
Standard, even if you are using Datacenter to license the VMs, unless you KNOW you need Datacenter features in the VMs. There are very few feature differences between Standard and Datacenter VMs, so this is unlikely.

If you use Windows Standard to license hosts, you can still move VMs without SA, you just need to have enough licensed capacity on the hosts at all times. SA does not provide license mobility for Windows Server.
 
Licensing Microsoft guest VMs works same in VMware and Hyper-V. You cannot legally run a Windows 20XX Datacenter VM on a host that only has Windows 20XX Standard license(s) assigned to it. **FULL STOP**.
 
I still recommend that you use Windows Standard as the guest OS. Maybe you need to move VM to a 4th host, even temporarily. If the guest was Datacenter, then you would NEED to license the host with Datacenter, as opposed to the much less expensive Windows Standard license.
 
When clicking on "Advanced system settings", I need to login as the administrator and hence only edit the administrators environment variables (in addition to the machine wide ones). **How do I edit the environment variables of a standard user?**
 
When I try to change per user environment variables via the control panel I have to login as an administrator.But since I run that part of the control panel as the administrator I can only edit the administrators variables.
 
**How am I supposed to edit my own environment variables?** Without resorting to extreme measures, such as editing the registry (as suggested in "Is there any command line tool that can be used to edit environment variables in Windows?" )

Generally, I have noticed that simply searching for something in the start menu or control panel is much faster than trying to remember a series of icons, dialogs, etc. one has to access to find something. At least for the vast majority of tasks1.
 
From the command line, you can create/modify persistent environment variables using the setx command, which is included in Windows Vista (and presumably Windows 7 too) and was part of the Windows Resource Kit Tools before that.
 
In case you wish to edit an environment variable for a particular account but that variable is a part of system variables (which might be the case if you are setting path for a particular plugin) e.g. **Path** in Windows, you can achieve this by appending a semi-colon, if required, followed by %variable\_value% like so:
 
Thanks @Mauro\_Gerber and @txnelson for the proposals. In my case "run program" did work after some correction of the path string (fileshare starting with // on windows 10), the proposal with "web" did not work, I tried several times, it looks elegant.
 
Hey everyone! I have been trying to follow all the steps given to download swift, but when i try and run anything i get this error message. But, in VScode's terminal I am able to run swift repl perfectly. Any idea what could have gone wrong? I am using windows 11 and have checked that SDKROOT is in the systems variables. Any help would be very much appreciated!
 
Speaking generally, that means the compiler could not find the standard library, often because the triple you're using to compile is different from the triple the standard library was built with. Compile with the -v flag and check what -sdk or -resource-dir the compiler is looking for the stdlib in, and make sure the stdlib swiftmodules are in there and that the triples they use match your -target. Most likely you haven't setup the toolchain properly for Windows.
 
Really appreciate the reply! Honestly, as I'm no expert in the field, i am not able to properly follow your advice to check if the stdlib swiftmodules are there. i tried running -v . in my VS Code terminal but i am getting an error saying that the term "-v" is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. What is the correct way to compile with this flag to be able to proceed with the next steps? Thank you for your time!
 
I only use it on macOS and Linux, @compnerd is the Windows platform champion. I just got VS Code extension configured for WASM, so you might wanna try on macOS or Linux and just specify the SDK and triple.
 
This is due to limitations in LLDB's codebase. I've posted multiple times in great detail what the issue is but no one else seems to be stepping up to do the work. I recommend that you compile and execute the code instead of trying to use the REPL.
 
You should be able to forcefully load the standard library and dependencies by explicitly mapping in the dependent DLLs in reverse post-order traversal and set the library search path. That is sufficient to enable the REPL. There are examples of that in GH issues as well as the forums.
 
Hello Saleem! Thank you for the detailed reply. I had already seen your replies on other posts talking about similar issues, but I thought as we are talking about an older module of Swift I wouldn't be encountering such issues myself (running Swift v5.7.1), as it is stated here (Swift.org - Getting Started) that support files are only required for versions older than 4.5.2.
Circling back to the issue, I had a hard time understanding some of the terms you used as I'm a beginner in this whole space. but, from what I could grasp and following your reply on a previous post, should i try running this in my command prompt?
 
Ok Saleem, I tried looking it up but couldn't find any sources explaining how to follow these steps. Can you link me to where you went over them or any sources you have explaining how to do it? That would be very much appreciated!
 
Although the REPL does work, it continuously regresses, and there is currently insufficient help to keep it in a great shape. It would be good to get more community support to keep the REPL in a working state at all times on Windows.
 
Yes, the first command fails because that was something local that I was sharing the contents of. It indicated what the contents of the file are. You will need to create the file and adjust the contents to have it work.
 
After the transition, the Windows Server Essentials features remain on the server and are supported for up to 75 users and 75 devices. If you exceed either of these limits, you should use the Windows Server native tools to manage user accounts and devices.
 
This process can take 20-30 minutes in my experience. I have also seen it hang once indefinitely and not work. Unfortunately we were not able to figure that one out. If you are still having trouble though, I would review the CBS and DISM logs from the time you tried the upgrade. These logs can be found in the C:\windows\logs folder.
 
To upgrade the edition from Essentials to Standard, you just run the dism set-edition command. Following the steps above is all you need to do to upgrade and remove the restrictions, but not the features, of Essentials.
 
Hi there. We have a customer who has a DC (host) with Server essentials 2016 and a VM with Server 2016 Standard. Their VM is showing as not activated and is using KMS. We are looking to activate the VM with a retail license key.
 
To answer the first question. No features will be lost by upgrading the host. Just keep in mind Essentials features are only designed for a max of 75 users.
Activating the VM should be fairly straightforward. Just run these two commands: slmgr /upk followed by slmgr /ipk
 
I must add there are a couple of problems that should be addressed with the environment. First, you should never run the ADDS and Hyper-V role on the same host OS install. Second, when running any roles or applications other than Hyper-V on the host, you only get one VM license. The reason for this is that the Standard license only permits running 2 instances of the OS for workloads, not 3. Lastly, if you upgrade Essentials edition to Standard, make sure and purchase some CALs as the included 25 CALs with Essentials do not upgrade to Standard CALs.
 
Now I want to remove the Essential Features but the TurnOffFeaturesWizard tool is missing both through the Dash Board and in Bin folder. Are you able to help with resolution of this? Any help will be appreciated.
 
I purchased a new license for 2019 Standard and receive the following error. Any tips?:
Error: 87
The specified product key could not be validated.
Check that the specified product key is valid and that it matches the target edition.
 
I have a server 2016 standard I just built (PDC). I would like to downgrade it to essentials (bought a license key) so I do not have to deal with CALS. I have only 23 pc in enterprise, 2 printers, only 3 users. I only use it as a file server to house files.
 
Everyone I know who has used this program, and I know many, have complained and agonized over how to minimize, maximize or close the window as the program does not open in a standard way. There are no classic icons for performing these tasks , in the upper right hand corner of the window. I finally found that the way to trigger their appearance is to click on the that 'stretch box' icon , in the bottom toolbar. I heard a Function key will do it too. Why not have the program launch with this feature enabled ? Every other windows-based program does and we all want to be able to toggle between windows and programs. Thanks.
 
I don't understand your problem. Stellarium can work in two modes - fullscreen and windowed. In the fullscreen mode all control elements of the operating system is hidden and this mode used by default. In the windowed mode workspace of Stellarium is standard window in operati
