There's a warning as the game boots up that "All actions performed by the main character are designed for ENTERTAINMENT ONLY. DO NOT TRY ANY OF THIS AT HOME!" ... And **never** has better advice been given at the start of a video game. Please do not presume completing this game qualifies you to start taking electrical sockets apart or installing new ones...

Further tips such as "Remember! DO not put your fingers in the socket" as well as always switching off the fuse box are crucial advice and should be the first thing you do when attempting any electrical maintenance, whether it's in this game or at home. Even when you've completed this lighthearted simulator it's undoubtedly wise to seek out a qualified electrician rather than attempting most of the tasks in this game, possibly with the exception of changing a light bulb. I use the word "possibly" because I saw an idiot friend nearly electrocute himself attempting to insert a light bulb into a floor lamp many years ago. **Yes** Graham Barton, I'm talking about YOU. If you attempt to fiddle with a socket or switch without turning the fuse box off, you'll most likely get a fizzing sound, a red, blurred screen and the controller vibrates like an angry bee. Thankfully, doing this doesn't blow up your console, set fire to your eyebrows, give you smoking, frizzy hair or just simply kill you outright.
 
I'm going to start the actual review by mentioning that Electrician Simulator features EU plugs and sockets, so it all looks a bit alien to me, and although the principles are the same, it's a bit of a shame that they didn't localise the electrical fixtures & fittings for the US and UK markets.
 
So what kind of game is Electrician Simulator? Well... jobs come in via your laptop computer and when there's more than one you can choose the order in which they're done. There are basically two types; site jobs in people's homes and repair jobs you do in your workshop. Accept a job and walk to your truck, and you're transported to the site, there's no driving to sites in a virtual town, which is a bit of a shame as it may have given the game a wider appeal.
 
When accepting a job you're given a list of suggested items that you probably need, but if you are short of an item you can always pop back to base and buy said item(s). If the house has a PC then you can even order them on-site.

The tutorials are thorough and if you have any idea of how electronics work then the game is fairly easy to figure out, but it certainly doesn't lead you by the nose with constant naggy tutorials and warnings like some sims. To be honest, some jobs were a bit of a puzzle to figure out, but they're all logical so if you follow a standard mental checklist of what could go wrong with a switch, socket, appliance, model or toy and dissemble each part and test them, then you can't really go wrong.
 
The sub menu (X button) contains some of the most useful features. The left and right Triggers zoom the view out and in, and you can rotate the various items so you can get a better view. Electrician Simulator was released in September '22 on PC and it's unsurprising that this sort of sim is much better suited to mouse control, so selecting some items, lining up on small components can be fiddly even with the sensitivity turned down. A togglable "auto aim" assist makes selecting small objects such as small screws or solder points easier
 
We live in a throwaway World and some repair jobs seem to cost more than a new replacement would, but you get paid for your work anyway so it's just a matter of finding the fault, buying the replacement part and reassembling the item. Just like in real life, you're not going to get rich repairing old appliances or toys and the site jobs are where the money is.
 
You should beware that you'll get some very odd customers, including someone who is presumably a vampire cop and a little girl who wants you to power up a fridge and put a snowman in it... You always have a checklist of tasks to complete on a site job and although some faults can be obscure and tricky to track down it gives the game a puzzle game feel that I really enjoyed.
 
Downers are the previously mentioned less than stellar optimisation for a game controller, which sometimes makes positioning items and the camera overly fiddly, some glitching/clipping with objects and during cable installation, oh and the not insubstantial fact that your screwdriver isn't automatically selected when it's obvious you just want to loosen or tighten a screw, making it automatically selected would have saved me more than a few exasperated sighs.
 
An interesting diversion for sparky console and PC owners everywhere, Electrician Simulator can be filed in the "fun" end of the simulation category and is priced at a very reasonable 15.49. I played the similarly-themed Rover Mechanic Simulator and Tin Can last year and I think this is better than both, despite a few flaws.
 
The VR electrician training application revolutionizes electrician training by providing an immersive and interactive experience. It offers a comprehensive platform where electricians can practice various tasks and scenarios in a virtual environment, including wiring installations, troubleshooting electrical systems, safety protocol adherence, and handling emergencies. With realistic simulations and hands-on practice, electricians can sharpen their skills, improve their confidence, and stay updated with the latest industry standards without the risks associated with real-world training.
 
A simulator works by leveraging virtual reality technology to create immersive and interactive training environments for electricians. Users wear a VR headset that immerses them in a virtual environment where they can interact with simulated electrical systems, equipment, and scenarios. The simulator typically includes realistic representations of wiring systems, electrical fixtures, tools, and equipment commonly used in electrical work.
 
Users can perform hands-on tasks such as wiring installations, circuit troubleshooting, and equipment maintenance within the virtual environment using motion controllers or other input devices. Real-time feedback and assessment mechanisms provide users with guidance on their performance and help them track their progress. Additionally, the simulator may include instructional content, tutorials, and scenario-based learning experiences to enhance the training process.
 
You can use a VR electrician simulator by accessing the software on a compatible platform or device. Begin by launching the simulator application and selecting the desired training module or scenario. Put on your VR headset and familiarize yourself with the virtual environment, which may resemble various real-world electrical settings such as residential homes, commercial buildings, or industrial facilities.
 
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA), the United States is expected to have a shortage of electricians in the near future. Statistically, the number of retiring electricians is outpacing the rate of new electricians entering the field, with 10,000 electricians retiring each year and only 7,000 entering the field in return.
 
**IVRY Technologies** is the start-up Virtual Reality (VR) initiative created by IDEAL INDUSTRIES, INC., a global enterprise with companies serving technicians and workers across various industries, from electrical to construction to aerospace to automotive. They have partnered with the electrical training ALLIANCE (etA) to launch virtual reality training as a learning resource for electrical apprentices at Joint Apprenticeship Training Committee (JATC) centers across the United States. The program is currently in over 400 schools.
 
IVRY Technologies selected Groove Jones to develop an interactive training platform utilizing VR to train electrical apprentices on how to wire homes and commercial premises. The program, named VET (Virtual Electrical Training), can be customized for various training protocols, as well as complying with safety standards.
 
The initial product offering is designed to simulate the experience of an electrical apprentice training under the tutelage of a master electrician. The user is guided through the experience, first learning how to install a single-pole switch and gradually advancing to more complex procedures, such as installing a three-way switch circuit.
 
The training program is equipped with scoring metrics and data analytics for the instructors and training directors to gauge progress. Students can also review their scores to understand their strengths and areas of improvement.
 
Access to this emerging technology will lead to higher student enrollment in the participating organizations and allow for increased testing capabilities with the growing demand for remote, virtual learning.
 
Electrician Simulator gives the player the opportunity to become an electrician, working from the ground up after taking over the family business from their retiring father. Starting with simple jobs like replacing sockets, the player slowly gains more skills to become a truly successful electrician. As well as this, the player slowly grows their own set of equipment to help with those steadily more and more challenging tasks.
 
Elements of Electrician Simulator will feel rather familiar to those who have played other simulator games, with a similar set-up and control structure to similar grounded sim titles. This does not have the strangeness of Gas Station Simulator or the nonsense of Balconing Simulator, but instead something a little more earnest. The player takes job after job to move through the trade, earning reputation and gaining levels over time.
 
This does not mean that Electrician
