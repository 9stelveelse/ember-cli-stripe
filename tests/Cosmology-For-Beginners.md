When looking to buy a telescope under $400 for beginners, it is important to consider the aperture (the diameter of the telescope's primary lens or mirror), the focal length, and the type of mount. A larger aperture will allow for more light to enter the telescope, providing brighter and clearer images. A longer focal length will provide higher magnification, while a shorter focal length will provide a wider field of view. The type of mount, such as an altazimuth or equatorial mount, will affect the stability and ease of use of the telescope.

Both refractor and reflector telescopes have their own advantages and disadvantages. Refractor telescopes use lenses to gather and focus light, while reflector telescopes use mirrors. Refractor telescopes are generally better for viewing objects on Earth, while reflector telescopes are better for viewing deep space objects. For under $400, it is recommended to choose a reflector telescope as they typically have a larger aperture and therefore provide clearer images at this price point.
 
Yes, with a telescope under $400 for beginners, you will be able to see many planets and galaxies. However, the quality of the images may not be as clear as those seen through more expensive telescopes. The key is to have realistic expectations and to choose a telescope with a larger aperture and longer focal length for better views of these objects.
 
Some useful accessories to consider purchasing with your telescope under $400 for beginners include a sturdy tripod, additional eyepieces for different levels of magnification, a Barlow lens for increased magnification, and a finderscope to help locate objects in the sky. It is also important to invest in a star chart or astronomy app to help you navigate the night sky.
 
To ensure your telescope under $400 for beginners lasts for a long time, it is important to properly maintain and care for it. This includes regularly cleaning the lenses or mirrors, storing it in a safe and dry place, and using a dust cover when not in use. It is also recommended to avoid setting up the telescope near sources of heat or moisture, and to follow the manufacturer's instructions for any additional maintenance or care recommendations.

Cosmology is the study of the origin, evolution, and structure of the universe as a whole. It encompasses a wide range of topics such as the Big Bang theory, the formation of galaxies, and the properties of dark matter and dark energy.
 
Some popular and highly recommended cosmology books for beginners include "A Brief History of Time" by Stephen Hawking, "Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution" by Neil deGrasse Tyson and Donald Goldsmith, and "The Elegant Universe" by Brian Greene.
 
While a basic understanding of physics can be helpful, it is not necessary to have a strong background in the subject to understand cosmology books for beginners. Many authors strive to make complex concepts accessible to readers with varying levels of scientific knowledge.
 
Yes, there are many online resources available for learning about cosmology, such as online courses, lectures, and articles from reputable sources. Some popular websites include NASA's Cosmology 101 and the European Space Agency's Introduction to Cosmology.
 
Reading about cosmology can help expand your knowledge and understanding of the universe and our place within it. It can also stimulate critical thinking and curiosity about the fundamental questions of existence. Additionally, it can provide insight into scientific methods and processes, which can be applicable to other areas of study.
 
This resource gives a general introduction to cosmology; the branch of science that studies the Universe and attempts to explain how it came to be, why it is like it is today and how it will change in the future. The presentation concentrates on the Big Bang theory of the evolution of the Universe and provides some evidence for how this idea might explain things that people see around them.

INFLATION has become a cosmological buzzword in the 1990s. No self-respecting theory of the Universe is complete without a reference to inflation -- and at the same time there is now a bewildering variety of different versions of inflation to choose from. Clearly, what's needed is a beginner's guide to inflation, where newcomers to cosmology can find out just what this exciting development is all about. This is it -- new readers start here.
 
The reason why something like inflation was needed in cosmology was highlighted by discussions of two key problems in the 1970s. The first of these is the horizon problem -- the puzzle that the Universe looks the same on opposite sides of the sky (opposite horizons) even though there has not been time since the Big Bang for light (or anything else) to travel across the Universe and back. So how do the opposite horizons "know" how to keep in step with each other? The second puzzle is called the flatness problem This is the puzzle that the spacetime of the Universe is very nearly flat, which means that the Universe sits just on the dividing line between eternal expansion and eventual recollapse.
 
The flatness problem can be understood in terms of the density of the Universe. The density parameter is a measure of the amount of gravitating material in the Universe, usually denoted by the Greek letter omega (O), and also known as the flatness parameter. It is defined in such a way that if spacetime is exactly flat then O = 1. Before the development of the idea of inflation, one of the great puzzles in cosmology was the fact that the actual density of the Universe today is very close to this critical value -- certainly within a factor of 10. This is curious because as the Universe expands away from the Big Bang the expansion will push the density parameter away from the critical value.
 
If the Universe starts out with the parameter less than one, O gets smaller as the Universe ages, while if it starts out bigger than one O gets bigger as the Universe ages. The fact that O is between 0.1 and 1 today means that in the first second of the Big Bang it was precisely 1 to within 1 part in 10^60. This makes the value of the density parameter in the beginning one of the most precisely determined numbers in all of science, and the natural inference is that the value is, and always has been, exactly 1. One important implication of this is that there must be a large amount of dark matter in the Universe. Another is that the Universe was made flat by inflation.
 
Inflation is a general term for models of the very early Universe which involve a short period of extremely
