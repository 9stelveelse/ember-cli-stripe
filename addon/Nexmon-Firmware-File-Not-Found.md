The data in nexmon/firmwares at master seemoo-lab/nexmon GitHub seems pretty constant for the target chips, so that data can be in a common framework-nexmon package. The builder script builder/frameworks/nexmon.py can then include the right files in the include path / build process.

It is possible for the builder script to execute an arbitrary command. The ESP-IDF builder script for ESP32 does that e.g. for generating a specific file. Just calls cmake on a data\_file\_embed\_asm.cmake file and gets the output, using env.Execute(). See here.
 
The way that lets you circumvent the PlatformIO registry and work with local files is that you let your platform.json point to some valid,existing package but then in the platformio.ini of the project immediately overwrite it with e.g .platform\_packages = toolchain-gccarmnoneeabi@file://, see docs and example.
 
You will be offered to install the headers during the kernel installation.
To install them later manually , run the installer again like this:
shell]cd /usr/local/src/re4son-kernel\_4\*
./install.sh -e[/shell]
 
The nexmon drivers enable monitor mode and frame injection for the build in wifi chips of the Pi3B and Pi0W.
The re4son kernel includes the compiled nexmon drivers and firmware with -m6 and -m7 support.
To install, reboot after installing a new kernel and run:

The Re4son-Kernel supports ethernet gadget mode and both Pi zero armel images on this page have the usb0 interface enabled out of the box to allow the initial setup without any additional hardware except a micro usb cable.
Below the steps to get it working:
 
**EDIT:** I found out that my chipset had an SDIO interface, so the driver used is a FullMAC driver (brcmfmac). If I understand correctly, it means that I cannot do any modifications on it since the MAC layer is coded in hardware ... Anyone to corroborate that ? Any alternatives ?
 
Even though the BCM4339 is a FullMAC or HardMAC chip, that handles all PHY and MAC layer processing in an ARM Cortex-R4 processor that is included in the BCM4339 system on chip, it is possible to change the firmware running on that microcontroller.
 
To do this, we developed a C-based patching framework, that allows to write patches to the original firmware in C. We used it to enable monitor mode on the BCM4339. If you are interested in the project, please take a look at our nexmon project at -darmstadt.de/nexmon
 
Broadcom is one of the major vendors of wireless devices worldwide. They sellwireless chips labelled under the 43 series. You can find these chipsalmost everywhere from smartphones to laptops, smart-TVs and IoT devices. Youprobably use one without knowing it, for example if you have a Delllaptop, you may be using a bcm43224 or a bcm4352 card. It is also likely you use a Broadcom WiFi chip if youhave an iPhone, a Mac book, a Samsumg phone or a Huawei phone, etc.
 
In 2018 I did a 6 months internship at Quarkslab with the purpose of reproducing and porting publicly known vulnerabilities to other vulnerable devices, to learn and improve several common infosec practices and to contribute to increase Quarkslab's knowledge of these devices. In this blog post I provide an account of my journey which included obtaining, reversing and fuzzing the firmware, and finding a few new vulnerabilities.
 
Management frames are managed by an entity called MLME (MAC subLayerManagement Entity). Depending on the location of the core that processes MLME we get twomajor types of wireless chip implementations: SoftMAC, where the MLME is running inthe kernel driver, and HardMAC (also called FullMAC) where the MLME is in thefirmware, embedded in the chip. But life is not so simple andsome hybrid implementations also exist where, for example, probe responses andrequests are managed by the driver, but association requests andauthentication are dealt by the chip's firmware.
 
FullMAC devices offer better performance in terms of power consumptionand speed, that's why they are heavily used in smartphones and tend tobe the most used kind of chips in the market. Their main disadvantage isthat they limit ability of the users to send specific frames or toset them in monitor mode. For that one will need to edit directly the firmwarerunning on the chips.
 
From the Linux Operating System perspective the above gives us two majorlayouts of components in the wireless stack: When the wireless device is a SoftMAC device, thekernel will use a specific Linux Kernel Module (LKM) called 'mac80211'. This driver exposesthe MLME API in order to manage the Management frames, otherwise the kernel will use directly a hardware driverand offload MLME processing to the chip's firmware.
 
The Broadcom bcm43xxx series have both HardMAC and SoftMAC cards. Unfortunately we could not find all the datasheets for all the chips we analyzed. The few datasheets available have been released by Cypressafter their acquisition of the "IoT business" branch of Broadcom. It's worth mentioning that some chips integrate both WLAN and Bluetooth capabilities, like the bcm4339 or the bcm4330.
 
All the chips analysed use an ARM Cortex-M3 or an ARMCortex-R4 as the main MCU for non-time-critical operations, so wedeal with two similar instruction sets: armv7m and armv7r. TheseMCUs have one ROM and one RAM, their size varies depending on the chipset's version.
 
Firmwares used by these chips are split in two parts: one part iswritten into the ROM and cannot be modified, the other part isuploaded by the driver into the chip's RAM. By doing so the vendor isable to add new features or write updates for their chips, just bychanging the RAM portion of the firmware.
 
FullMAC chips are very interesting, first as stated before the MLMElayer is implemented into the firmware code, but they also offeroffloading features like ARP cache, mDNS, EAPOL, etc. These chipsalso have some hardware cryptographic modules allowing to encrypt anddecrypt the traffic, manage the keys, etc. All of the offloading features increasethe attack surface, giving us a nice playground.
 
The 'wl' driver is the most used on embedded systems like routers. It isalso usually used on laptops that have a chip not supported by thebrcmfmac/brcmsmac driver, like the bcm4352 chip on the Dell XPS.Also, the wl driver uses it's own MLME and doesn't need the LKM'mac80211' to process Management frames, expanding the attack surfacefor an attacker.
 
The version distributed by Broadcom is generally called an 'hybrid'driver because the main part of the code comes in two compiled ELF -objects used at compile time. Why two? because one is for thex86\_64 architecture and the other for i386. These objects hold the main code ofthe driver and therefore expose a lot of Broadcom API's functions.
 
As explained, the firmware is split in two parts. The easiest partto grab is the RAM part, which is loaded into the RAM by thedriver. This part contains code and data used by the main MCU but alsothe microcode used by the D11 core.
 
This part of the firmware is not signed, and integrity is 'verified' using a CRC32 checksum. This has lead to several firmware modifications in order to add functionalities like the monitor mode. For example,SEEMO Lab has released the NEXMON project [3], which is an amazingframework for modifying these firmwares by writing patches for them in C.
 
During our study we encountered two possible formats for the RAMfirmware image; the first and most commonly encountered was asimple binary blob with no particular structure. The second wasthe TRX format which could be easily parsed, when working on thebcm43236 chip.
 
When the driver used is brmfmac or bcmdhd we can get the RAM firmwaredirectly from the host filesystem. On linux we can find it in/lib/firmware/brcm or on Android in /system/vendor/firmware.In other cases it will vary depending on the system we use.
 
In order to grab the ROM part, we need to know where it is mapped.The best way to find the base address is to read the driver's header,for example in the bcmdhd's headers file /include/hndsoc.h[4]. An alternate way is to read the Nexmon project README [3]which gives us other base addresses depending on the MCU models. Theastute reader may see that these addresses differ. The Nexmon projectspecifies that the ROM for chips with a Cortex-M3 is loaded at0x800000, and the bcmdhd's header says at 0x1e000000. Both are correct. Itseems that the ROM and the RAM are mapped twice. Furthermore, knowing thebase address gives us a clue about the MCU used, for example if we dump the ROM at0x000f0000, we know that the chip is using an ARM Cortex-R4.
 
On Android, we can use the dhdutil tool which is an Androidopensource improved fork of the old wlctl utility. By using the'membytes' function of this tool we can dump the RAM of the chipsets,and in some cases the ROM as well.
 
For example, on the bcm4339 chip used in the Nexus 5 which relies on aCortex-R4, the ROM is directly dumped. Unfortunately, on the olderbcm4330 (Cortex-M3) this doesnt work. But as long as you can interact withthe RAM, it is possible to hook a function with a little stub whichwill copy the ROM, slice by slice, into an emtpy arena in the RAM. Afterthat we can dump all the ROM's slices.
 
On Linux with the brcmfmac driver, we cannot directly access the ROM. Therefore, we need to finda way to interact with the chip's memory, directly within the ROM or the RAM.Luckily, when the chip uses a SDIO bus for communicating with the host the opensource brcmfmac driverexposes the function brcmf\_sdiod\_ramrw. This function allows us to read and write into the chipset's RAMfrom the host.
 
Prior to calling brcmf\_sdiod\_ramrw, we must call sdio\_claim\_host in order to reclaimthe utilisation of the SDIO bus. Note that if the device is not connected to anyAccess Point, the device may be in a low power-
