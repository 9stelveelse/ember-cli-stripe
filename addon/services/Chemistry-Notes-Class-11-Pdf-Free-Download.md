It can be difficult to keep your notes organized throughout the school year, especially in a class that covers so much content. This article will give you **links to notes on every topic included in the AP Chemistry curriculum.** If you're missing some of your notes, or if you just want a more structured overview of what you need to know for the exam, you've come to the right place! We'll also give you some study tips so that you can use both these notes and the notes you took throughout the year to your best advantage.

**The notes in this article can be used to study smaller portions of the curriculum or to review for the final AP Chemistry exam.** There are currently nine units that organize all the concepts in the course, so we've categorized these notes according to that framework. Topics should be listed in roughly the same order as you learned them in class.
 
These notes will provide a ton of background information, but keep in mind that AP Chemistry is **less about memorization of facts and more about the ability to apply your knowledge** to a variety of experimental scenarios. Reading notes can only get you so far. **Practice problems are essential** (a point that I will emphasize again later in this article).
 
**Take a diagnostic test before you dive into these notes if you plan on using them to review for the full AP test.** Based on your results, you can see which areas need the most improvement, and then you can focus on the notes that are most relevant.
 
These notes come from several sources. Some are in-depth, others give a broad overview. Some are in-depth, others give a broad overview. Some focus more on explaining concepts, others on working through practice questions. The overall goal of these notes is to give you a comprehensive guide of what you need to know for AP Chemistry.
 
If you want to use these notes to your full advantage, you shouldn't just read them all and consider yourself prepared. For chemistry, you need to dig deeper to understand the material fully. That said, here are some tips to keep in mind:
 
If you're studying for chemistry, you should **work your way through concepts in the order of when they show up in the curriculum.** You need to master the basics first, or more advanced problems will look like complete gibberish to you. If there are any topics in Unit 1 that you don't feel comfortable with, start your studying with those. Everything else in the course builds on the concepts you learned in the first couple of months!
 
Every time you read a set of notes, **do a few practice problems to make sure you've absorbed the information.** Reading through these notes is a waste of time if they don't provide you with the background information and skills you need to solve relevant problems. If you find that you're having trouble with practice problems after you read through notes, this should be a red flag that you need to modify your study strategy.
 
**Don't forget about the notes you took in class, handouts your teacher gave to you, and any other resources you've accumulated throughout the year.** It's worthwhile to shop around and see whether certain explanations of concepts resonate more than others. You might decide that videos explaining concepts are more useful to you than notes, or you may choose to buy a review book that provides more guidance in planning out your studying.
 
It's unwise to cram for AP Chemistry. You need to do plenty of practice problems to feel comfortable with the material, and, if you cram, you won't be able to spend enough time on this. **Don't pull out your notes the day before the exam and expect to learn everything in one marathon study session.** You won't retain the information, and you'll be exhausted for the test.
 
**The notes in this article should help you review all the essential concepts you need to know for the AP Chemistry exam.** Make sure you supplement your review with practice tests so you can assess your progress and see where your main strengths and weaknesses lie. Also, **keep in mind the tips we went through in the last section:**
 
**Notes are all well and good, but when do you actually need to start using them to review for the test?** Find out how early you should start studying for AP exams if you're aiming for a great score.

The Class 12 Chemistry Chapter 2 Notes deal with the topic of Solutions. In everyday life, we come across pure substances on some occasions. Furthermore, most of these mixtures contain multiple pure substances whose utility is dependent on their composition. For Example, the properties of Brass are different in comparison to that of Bronze. Liquid solutions and their formations certainly play an essential role in Chemistry.
 
The Class 12 Chemistry Chapter 2 Notes covers each topic and subtopic related to solid, liquid, and gaseous solutions. It is a scoring topic, meaning it has good marks weightage, and the topic is easy to understand, in turn enabling students to score well. Extramarks Class 12 Chemistry Chapter 2 notes are the finest study materials that students refer to instead of turning pages of their textbooks again and again.
 
The solution is a homogeneous mixture of 2 or various substances in the same and different physical phases. The substances forming the solution are known as components of the Solution. A solution of two components is called a binary solution based on the number of components. Under this section of class 12 Chemistry chapter 2 notes, we will focus on liquid solutions and their various properties in this unit.

Apart from the class 12 Chemistry chapter 2 notes, students may also refer to NCERT books for more information.
 
Under this section of class 12 Chemistry chapter 2 notes, students learn about the concentration of solutions. The solution concentration refers to the amount of Solute dissolved per unit of solution.
 
As defined under the class 12 Chemistry chapter 2 notes, Solubility is a physical property of a solution. The solubility of a substance is its maximum amount that can be dissolved in a specified amount of solvent.
 
The solution of sugar or salt dissolved is a typical example of the solubility of a solid in a liquid. But not all solids need to dissolve in liquid. For Example, solids like naphthalene and anthracene do not mix in water but dissolve readily in benzene, but sugar and salt do not dissolve in benzene. This is because it is a property of Solution that polar solutes dissolve in polar solvents like water, ethanol, formaldehyde and chloroform, whereas nonpolar solutes in nonpolar solvents like toluene, pyridine, as well as hexane.
 
Aerated drinks and dissolved oxygen in water bodies that support aquatic life are natural instances of solubility of a gas in a liquid. HCl is also highly soluble in water. The phenomenon of an increase in the concentration of solution due to the dissolving of solid solute to the solvent is called dissolution.
 
Dissolution of salt in water: The process of collision of solute particles in a solution resulting in the separation of the solute particles from the solution is called crystallisation. An example includes the Crystal of copper sulphate obtained by the crystallisation of Copper Sulphate solution.
 
At the constant temperature, different gasses have different *K*H. It is a role of the nature of the gas. At a given pressure increasing the value of *K*H implies lower solubility of the gas in the liquid. The value of*K*H increases with the increase in temperature; Hence solubility of gases increases with decreasing temperature. Because of this reason, cold water is more sustainable for aquatic life than warm water.
 
Students may refer to **CBSE revision notes**, **CBSE sample papers** and important questions in addition to class 12 Chemistry chapter 2 notes while preparing for the board examination.
 
Let the solvent be represented by one and solute be represented by 2. At this point, if the solute is non-volatile, just the solvent molecules are present in the vapour phase and add to vapour pressure.
