The state of Iowa protects your rights as citizens to have your vehicle repaired at any repair facility of your choosing. Unfortunately, there is a lot of confusion on this one, you may be told by an agent or adjuster that you have to go to a certain repair shop, and its simply not true.
 
There is a multitude of reasons for this, mainly due to estimates written before a thorough teardown of the car has been performed. Insurance adjusters cannot see the full extent of damages due to an accident, so their initial estimate can reflect quite differently than the final repair costs. Most times any additional cost is covered with a supplement payment. Of course, we always review with the customer before doing any additional work beyond the original claim.
