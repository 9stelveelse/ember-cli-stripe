Hi
I want to build a led matrix like city TV with ws2812 led.I don't have any problem with hardware and micro software.
I want a software to code data like pictures and videos. Hd2014 software is a suitable for this job, but I don't know how data coded in it!
After a long time I understand how time save in time.hds, but I don't know ho data saved in default.hds file.
I build a 16\*8 project in hd2014 and type 'H' with red color in it.
The code that software generated is:
 
"An HDS file extension is used by Microsoft PlayReady, a Digital Rights Management program for streaming online video. HDS files are most commonly encountered during Microsoft Silverlight software upgrades, which can cause Netflix streaming to malfunction."
