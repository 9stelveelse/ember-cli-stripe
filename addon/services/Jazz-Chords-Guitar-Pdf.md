In order to help you learn the construction of each chord in this lesson, the intervals for each shape have been written on the fretboard, which will help you understand how all of these chords have been constructed.
 
In the example above, the starting fret is the 7th fret. This means you put your finger on the 8th fret on the lowest string, a finger on the 9th fret of the D-string, a finger on the 9th fret of the G-string, and finally a finger on the 8th fret of the B-string.
 

The **x symbols** at the left side of the chord indicate that those strings are not to be played. This means most of the chords in these chord charts cannot be strummed but must be played fingerstyle, with the thumb and first three fingers of your right hand.
 
These must-know chord voicings are essential for any beginning jazz guitarist and the minimum requirement to learn jazz standards. If you memorize every chord shape and practice them well, you will be able to play the chord changes of most jazz standards.
 
Learning jazz chords is best done by playing songs and practicing the chord progression exercises that are below the jazz chord chart. When you have these exercises under your fingers, start playing other chord progressions.

Since we are looking at easy jazz chords in this lesson, you will only use one altered note per chord. Over time you might find yourself drawn to use two altered notes when playing these types of chords, such as 7(b9,b5) for example.
 
To begin, here are three ii-V-I-VI chord progressions that use the shapes from this lesson in their makeup. After you have learned these initial examples, make sure to take them to other keys in order to practice them around the entire fretboard.
 
You can substitute any other chord from the same family into these progressions in order to expand upon them in your studies. For example, if the chord is Cmaj7, you could play a C6 or C6/9 chord in its place as they are all from the same family of chords.
 
As was the case with the major key examples, feel free to expand upon these chord progressions by taking them to other keys, as well as substitute other chord shapes from this lesson into these progressions.
 
This has been always puzzling to me: In the chord diagrams, why do people depict the thick E string at the bottom? As I am holding my instrument, the thick E is always on the top. I have to perform mental arithmetic to rotate the diagram to match what I see when I look at how I actually finger a chord. Just want to know what is the logic for the way chords are depicted here?
 
I am wondering how you would analyze the diminished chords in chord exercise number 5? Are they considered passing chords? Also, would a jazz player consider the A7 as a V of ii or just a Major II chord? Do you have any courses on understanding jazz theory? I would love to understand jazz theory better. Thanks so much!
 
Might it also be G#m6#5? For example I have seen it named that way (and I hear Gilberto play that exact voicing in the Getz/Gilberto recording) where it appears as the second chord in the A sections of Corcovado, between the Am6 and the Gm7. (Although in that context, since the key is C and the chord is used in a chromatic descent, the naming is more often Abm6#5 whereas your exercise is in G and the movement is ascending)
 
Hello Master ,
I am practising according to you book ,How to play perfect Cmaj7 -drop3 chord (page 21) by without playing open string A ,root position of C at 8th fret. When I am playing I am hitting the open string A .
 
Hi Ramesh, drop 3 chords are usually played fingerstyle: play the bass note with your thumb and the rest of the notes with fingers 1, 2, and 3. If you want to strum these chords, you have to mute the open A string with finger 1 from the fretting hand (the same finger that is fretting the bass note). I hope that clarifies it!
 
Hi, is there a particular reason why fingerings are not noted for the chord shapes?
I find proper fingerings essential, especially to know what possible anchor fingers to use when switching to a new shape.
Or is the idea that there are basic common fingerings for each shape that one can easily look up on the web?
 
What a great lesson, such an excellent way to learn chords and progressions. Exactly what I am looking for. Spent most of the evening going through the progressions. Your lessons are super, keep em comming ?
 
Only managed to have a very quick look at these last night but looking forward to trying these .. I did try a couple but in latin time .. gorgeous!! More super stuff to learn and add to my guitar vocabulary!! Many thanks.
 
You guys are wonderful. the formats that you present are all so easy to understand and laid out in such a logical manner. I look forward to every Email i recieve from you. It is a joy! Keep up the excellent work. All the best to you from Vernon British Columbia Canada
 
hi can you explain or at least point me in the direction,of how you know on which beat to come in on,on singing/playing a tune.
if you dont have the sheet music? never understood how you know this and never seen any explaination.
feel a right dummy having to ask.!
 
Thank you for the Chords, Ive Been reading many articles and books about music theory, but wasnt able to get chords. Now, with this excelente chords that you uploaded I have more information for practicing what I have learned. Thank you very much Dirk!
 
Hey great lesson and it was exactly what I needed right now! But I noticed the G6/9 major chord does not contain the 3rd (B) but it does contain the 5th (D). I thought the 3rd was more important than the fifth because it provides the major quality. Is this something we should try to avoid if we can (i.e. by stretching the finger down to barre on the 3rd, 6th & 9th or moving the 5th down 3 frets)? Which voicing would be better for a jazz situation?
 
Great lesson, in spite of considering myself an intermediate player with decent rhythm and comping chops this lesson is a welcome refresher. It is too easy to slip into lazy or convenient fingerlings and lose track of the (available) alternatives.
 
Take for an example, a 1573-shaped dominant 7-chord with the root on 5th string: there is a considerable stretch needed for the 3rd and 4th fingers. The lower on the fretboard you voice the chord, the bigger the stretch, right?
 
kinda hard to hold and play a guitar with a computer in front. If these were extracted from a book I could buy and put on a music stand it would be more practical. Because of this I dont understand how all the guys above find this so great.
 
Thank you so much ,,,, it helps me as a blues player to gett in the jazz , it is not easy but i have so much fun to play 2-5-1 progressions and learn new cords on that way.
i have a long way to go ,but every day i learn something new .
 thank you mister Dirk.

I can only imagine how much work goes into assembling this lesson, which I and others greatly appreciate. Would you consider supplementing it with a YouTube video to help on the most efficient fingers for the exercises?
 
what a nice way to begin to play jazz , the beginner chords helps to build up the your chord , tones , voicing and also helps your fingers to be flexible , how can you help me to build up to the intermediate level in jazz , please can you send me a lesson on how you can improvise on the beginners jazz chord lesson. keep the good work am really learning from your lessons.
 
Thank you for your lessons. I am very new here, first steps in jazz, and I have not used tabs before. I am not familiar with the graphical presentation of chords above. I guess vertical lines are strings, and horizontal are frets? Black dots are fingers? What are the small gray dots? Also not sure of positions, because fret numbers are not marked? I have used to barr type chords when playing dance music here. That is why I am very confused. Could someone explain?
 
Hi Ollie, horizontal lines are strings, vertical lines are frets. Black dots are fingers, grey dots are the same dots as on your fretboard. Frets are marked by a number below the diagram, no number indicates first position.
 
thank you so very much Dirk for some really great lessons
i am a senior citizen still thinking like a hippie
playing guitar for most of my life in bands
now just for myself and i still love the challenge of learning
something different every day
again thank you for making my time quality time

Dirk, Many years ago I bought the Micky Baker Jazz Method. It took awhile for me to learn the basic Jazz chord changes. I see that you have presented these chords in a straight forward manner. Thanks for demystifying this important part of learning Jazz.
 
I am a visual artist, so I am not always able to follow the lessons in time, but it is just so convinving and seducing all the stuff you send! I am sure I will go through all of it as soon as possible. I have already studied a bit your chord construction lesson with good results ?
 
Dirk great idea for that kind of lesson. If it is meant for beginners its maybe more easy for them if you insert the fingering instead of the interval relationship into the chart. Just a hint from a colleague.
 
i have played guitar for many years as a singer, last few yrs into jazz guitar. retired for 7yrs, found getting into a band of great benefit! you will soon find the things that are hard that you wont find playing alone. currently in four bands (all different) this type of info will set you right, and for
