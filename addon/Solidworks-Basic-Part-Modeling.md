Part modeling is the process of creating a virtual prototype of something by modeling each individual part separately, which can then all be assembled together to create the model of the final product. Think of all of the different parts of a car engine for example.

As an Elite Applications Engineer at GoEngineer, Tony Riggs specializes in SOLIDWORKS and rapid prototyping. He is a Certified SOLIDWORKS Expert as well as a Certified SOLIDWORKS Instructor. His duties include training, technical support and product demonstrations of SOLIDWORKS and several other products that we carry. Prior to this position he worked as a Mechanical Engineer at FlightSafety International where he helped with the design of flight simulators. He has been using SOLIDWORKS for over... more 18 years.
 
At the end of this book, you will have a fairly good understanding of the SOLIDWORKS interface and the most commonly used commands for part modeling, assembly and detailing after completing a series of components and their 2D drawings complete with Bill of Materials.
 
Throughout this book the author introduces you to new commands that are required to pass the Certified SOLIDWORKS Associate exam, as listed on the SOLIDWORKS website. A dedicated chapter provides you with details about the exam, as well as a practice test to help you prepare for the actual exam.

SOLIDWORKS is an easy to use CAD software that includes many time saving tools that will enable new and experienced users to complete design tasks faster than before. Most commands covered in this book have advanced options, which may not be covered in this book. This is meant to be a starting point to help new users to learn the basic and most frequently used commands.
 
Each copy of this book includes access to video instruction. In these videos the author provides a clear presentation of tutorials found in the book. The videos reinforce the steps described in the book by allowing you to watch the exact steps the author uses to complete the exercises while he provides additional details along the way. Captioned versions of these videos are also available for customers who want or need video captions.

Advanced Modeling focuses on making freeform-type parts using sweeps, lofts, and blends. You'll go beyond the basics and also learn how to use guide curves, curve paths, and even continuity controls to help you create organic-style geometry in your SOLIDWORKS parts. Bridging, local operations, and other multi-body modeling techniques are also covered.

GSC is hands-down the best place to go for your software training. Their staff are incredibly friendly, knowledgeable, and hospitable. One of the other students in my training course was a disabled lady, and GSC went above and beyond to accommodate her needs without making her feel less capable than anyone else in the room. The facility itself is very comfortable and has a wonderful aesthetic and is jam-packed with all kinds of fascinating materials, processes, and tools - and their staff would be more than happy to share any of those experiences with you!
 
I had played around in the software a bit prior to taking the course and encountered several issues. Now that I've taken the course at GSC, I'm much more confident that I'll be able to overcome those issues when I get back to my projects.
 
One of the best training sessions I have taken in my 32-year career. The instructor showed a complete mastery of the subject, but could still meet students where they were starting from, and lead them to a better understanding of the material.
 
GSC's online training courses are fundamentally brilliant, with the expertise in instructors and the dense materials that they offer to you. This is my second online class for 3D CAD software and it was definitely worth it!
 
For those familiar with AutoCAD, this course incorporates the features, commands, and techniques used to create, edit, and print 3D drawings with AutoCAD hands-on exercises throughout the course explore creating 3D wire frame models, 3D surface models, 3D solid models, and making multi-view drawings. Prerequisites: working knowledge of AutoCAD and Microsoft Windows OS, plus understanding of basic drafting skills and blueprint reading. 
Tuition $495 (plus text).
 
Focused around a hotel suite project, AutoCAD for the Interior Designer provides the Interior Design student with a non-intimidating, tutorial based approach to learning the AutoCAD program. It accomplishes this by taking students that have no computer design experience from simple commands to complete projects.
 
The course covers the concepts and introduces Revit tools to create a schematic design from construction documentation to design visualization. Pre-requisite: A working knowledge of computers, MS Windows, and previous experience in architectural design, drafting or engineering is necessary. No previous CAD experience is necessary. 
Tuition $495 (plus text).
 
Entry level instructional course consisting of how to use the Autodesk drafting software Revit 2016 with a specific focus on Structural drafting. To take full advantage of Building Information Modeling, the Autodesk Revit 2016 Structure Fundamentals has been designed to teach you the concepts and principles from building design through construction documentation using the Autodesk Revit 2016 Structure software. This course is intended to introduce you to the user interface and the basic building components of the software that makes it a powerful and flexible structural modeling tool. The goal is to familiarize you with the tools necessary to create, modify, and document the parametric model.
Tuition $495 (plus text).
 
SolidWorks is an easy-to-use CAD software for building parametric models of parts and assemblies. In this introductory course, students will learn the basic concepts of SolidWorks and good solid modeling techniques. Instruction will focus on the commonly used commands for part modeling, assembly, and detailing components, but also on the processes to complete the modeling of a part. Prerequisites: A working knowledge of PCs and Windows operating systems is necessary. An understanding of basic drafting and mechanical design is helpful.

This tutorial introduces the new user to some of the tools and techniques used in the PartDesign Workbench. This tutorial is not a complete and comprehensive guide to the Part Design Workbench and many of the tools and capabilities are not covered. This tutorial will take user through the steps needed to model the part shown in the image below using sketches.
 
In this tutorial, you will be using the Part Design Workbench to create a 3D solid model of the part shown in the Drawing below. All of the necessary dimensions to complete this task are given. You will start by creating a core shape from a base Sketch and then build on that shape, adding what is known as Features. These features will either add material to, or remove material from the solid by use of additional sketches and accompanying feature operations. This Tutorial will not use every feature and tool available within the Part Design Workbench, but should use enough to give the user of this tutorial a basic foundation upon which to build their knowledge and skills.
 
First begin by making sure you are in the Part Design Workbench. Once there, you will want to create a new document if you have not done so already. It is a good habit to save your work often, so before anything else save the new document, giving it any name you might like.
 
*Note: it's possible that the OK button may not be visible if the side panel is not wide enough. You can make it wider by dragging its right border. Place your mouse pointer over the border; when the pointer changes to a two-way arrow, press and hold the left mouse button and drag.*
 
Next you will want to use the Polyline tool and make a shape roughly like that in the next image. It does not need to be perfect as the final shape is done with constraints. Once you have the basic shape, we will start applying the constraints. If you had Auto constraints on, some of these constraints will have been applied automatically, if not, do the following. But first make sure that you have exited the Polyline tool by right-clicking or pressing ESC twice; the mouse cursor should turn back from a cross-hair to the standard arrow cursor. Don't press ESC a third time or you will exit edit mode; if this happens, click on the Model tab, then double-click the Sketch element in the tree, or right-click and select **Edit sketch** in the context menu. To avoid leaving edit mode when pressing Esc too often, change the **Esc can leave sketch edit mode** preference (introduced in version 0.19), see Sketcher Preferences.
