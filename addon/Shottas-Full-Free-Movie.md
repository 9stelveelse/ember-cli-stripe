A raw urban drama about two friends raised on the dangerous streets of Kingston, Jamaica. Biggs and Wayne take on the "Shotta" way of life to survive. As young boys, they begin a life of crime, eventually moving to the US where they begin a ruthless climb from the bottom. They remain bound to each other by their shottas loyalty as they aggressively take control of the Jamaican underworld.

It's good, it's hyper violent. There's almost no point in the movie where there isn't gunplay. I would've preferred a movie solely set on Jamaica but the close proximity to Miami makes enough sense to have it in both settings. Unflinching in how people are easily dispatched at a gangsters whim. The blood flows freely in this movie set to a backdrop of songs from Jamaican artists.
 
After an awkwardly-filmed opening scene it flashes back to some early scenes in Jamaica that seem to be playing in interesting ways with the American dream, and what it means to have gone to America and gotten sent home with nothing--a post-colonial connection where the island has to struggle as a result of America's retrograde policies, but that falls by the wayside for a determinedly uphill struggle to reenact something that's more along the lines of Scarface. (Albeit Scarface filmed in your backyard, with your friends, when your mom's not home. Good soundtrack, though)
 
*Shottas* is not a good movie. It makes an attempt to tell the violent rise to wealth of two young Jamaican men through drug-and-gun gangster tropes, but is so unbelievably underwritten and lackadaisically acted for everything to settle and slumber at a low mumbling hum.
 
There is clear effort behind the production with a fittingly plain but decently crafted cinematography, and decent mise-en-scene, props, locations and effects (oh, so many squibs...!) But everything else is so lacklustre and boring.
