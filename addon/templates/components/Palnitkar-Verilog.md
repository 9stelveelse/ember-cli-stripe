Verilog, first and foremost, is a hardware description language. So you need to have some background in digital design (or at least get yourself familiar with it). Also, the answer to your question will depend on the reason you want to learn Verilog:
 
There are a number of good text books out there. Online tutorials can introduce the major concepts but there are far fewer hardware engineers using Verilog than there are programmers writing software. You won't get far trying to learn from the few web sites out there.
 
Of course, there is no point in learning Verilog if you aren't very familiar with digital logic design principles. Verilog is a modeling language, after all, and it is necessary to understand the hardware to model it properly.

This book uses all synthesizable codes. The most important thing when programming with HDL (Hardware descriptive language) is that you have to keep what hardware are you making in FPGA with your verilog code statement. For example you make a mux when you use assign statement e.t.c.
 
check this out. This can help write good verilog code with interactive syntax corrections. VGuru is first of its kind Learn-Practice-Teach platform. On the mobile device with less number of key strokes, we can complete a verilog code. Just by a click we can create testbench. =skand+vlsi
 
IEEE Std 1364-2005. Verilog Hardwar Description Language. Piscataway, New Jersey: The IEEE Computer Society, 2005.(pdf) [Revised in 2001 and reaffirmed, with System Verilog added compatibility, in 2005. If you plan to do any serious work in verilog, you should have a copy of the standard. It is not oly normative, but it includes numerous examples and explanatory notes concering every detail of the language.]
