Please download the Farbar Recovery Scan Tool and save it to your desktop.

Note: You need to run the version compatible with your system. You can check here if you're not sure if your computer is 32-bit or 64-bit
 
Hey I'm confused. i ran the Farbar Recovery tool again and read through it and it says Windows Defender has detected a virus, Please view the "virus" screenshot that shows the message. Something is seriously wrong with my laptop, I think there is a hacker on it.
 
**NOTICE:**This script was written specifically for this user, for use on this particular machine. Running this on another machine may cause damage to your operating system that cannot be undone.

Run **FRST**or**FRST64** and press the **Fix** button just once and wait.
If the tool needs a restart please make sure you let the system restart normally and let the tool complete its run after restart.
The tool will make a log on the Desktop (**Fixlog.txt**) or wherever you ran FRST from. Please attach or post it to your next reply.
 
**NOTE-1:** This fix will run a scan to check that all Microsoft operating system files are valid and not corrupt and attempt to correct any invalid files. It will also run a disk check on the restart to ensure disk integrity. Depending on the speed of your computer this fix may take 30 minutes or more.
 
**NOTE-2:**As part of this fix all temporary files will be removed. If you have any open web pages that have not been bookmarked please make sure you bookmark them now as all open applications will be automatically closed. Also, make sure you know the passwords for all websites as cookies will also be removed. The use of an external password manager is highly recommended instead of using your browser to store passwords.
 
**NOTE-3:**As part of this it will also reset the network to default settings including the firewall. If you have custom firewall rules you need to save please export or save them first before running this fix.
 
**Important:** items are **permanently** deleted. They are not moved to quarantine. **If you have any questions or concerns please ask before running this fix.**

I have been working on the task of scanning CVE and licenses with Sonatype (Nexus IQ) CLM scan tool. While looking into below sonatype document, it seems that Sonatype currently does not supports Nix packages scanning.
 
There are a whole raft of security tools that out there, nix is very suited to those that can do static analysis of source code and it is also very good at dynamic analysis tools thanks to the way nixos full integration tests work.
 
Thanks for your reply. Can you please suggest any CVE & OSS license scanning tool which can scan nix packages successfully after download on my maching and generates CVE report.
It will be great if you can provide any nix user documentation where a nix user has successfully used any scanning tool to generate CVE report.

As renewable energy and power electronics proliferate on the grid, it is critical to understand how these devices will affect grid stability. But there are far too many devices and commercial varieties to assess each device analytically and individually. Instead, the industry needs a versatile and tech-agnostic approach to determine device impacts quickly and confidently.
 
NREL has a software tool to perform impedance scans of devices, which evaluate how renewable energy resources interact with one another and the grid at multiple timescales and for various operations. This software is compatible with any renewable energy device and can prevent early mistakes in project planning.
