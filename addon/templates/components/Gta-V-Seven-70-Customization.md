After installing the open-vm-tools-deploypkg I converted the VM to a templateonce again and attempted to provision using Terraform. This time I got past theerror that I was originally getting but this time the VMs would spin up and thecustomization would run but the VM hostnames and static IP addresses were notbeing configured. I was making progress but why was this not working still? SoI did some more Google searches and found a blurb that triggered my memory on this,**Perl**, Perl is a requirement for the customization to work correctly. So I convertedthe template to a VM once again and spun it up, and sure enough, Perl was notinstalled. So after installing perl:

So I just spent two hours of my life trying to get my CentOS 7 VM template to deploy correctly with a vSphere customization specification. No matter what I did it would customize the VM, then uncustomize it, essentially leaving me with the template again. I finally asked our oracle and savior, Google, and two amazing things occurred.
 
Hi Bob, thanks for the post. Do you feel that it is better to use VMware Tools instead of open-vm-tools (as packaged by the Linux distribution)? I only recently discovered open-vm-tools. It looks fine for me. Any views on it?

Do you often find yourself browsing Nexus to find character customization mods when you're playing games like Fallout, Baldur's Gate, or Skyrim? Do you like your character to look like they can grow more than ten individual hairs at a time? Do you like to look like you didn't lose your sense of style when the apocalypse hit?

 
**How to Make Sure the Hairstyles Will All Fit Right and Look Right:**
On the main menu of 7 Days to Die, click on the following: Options > Player Profile > Click the Character you play as > "Edit" and then do the following:
Set Head Size, Head Width, and Forehead Size to 0.50.
To make it look even better: Set your character hairstyle to Bald and choose a brown/natural color.

 
**Known Bugs:**
If you go into 3rd person view, or into and out of a vehicle, with a hairstyle equipped, you can see weird artifacts of the hairstyle in first person. Remove the helmet the hair is attached to and put it back on and it's fixed! (This is a 7 Days issue, not a me issue, so it's not something I can fix at the current time.)
 
I can confirm this is for A21.2, and it is required to install it on both the Client and Server, where appropriate, due to custom assets. I could assist with the introductory video, and the creator mentioned they had been called away, but was eager to share this beforehand. It is possibly my fault for any delay in posting additional identifying info, as I delayed the process because... I was doing my hair.
 
As Arramus said, it's very much for A21.2! Client and Server requirements are listed in the description already, but I made them more highlighted. Apologies for my late response, I've been out of town!

The **Mako Customization 7** item is a companion customization you can only purchase in the VIP section of the Fleet if you have the Collector's Edition of Star Wars: The Old Republic. They are not very expensive, but only a small handful of players have the Collector's Edition, so they are very rare to see in the game.
 
These customizations are Bind on Pickup, so they sadly can not be sold or traded to other players. They also can not be acquired on the opposite faction and are restricted to the vendor on the correct faction, in this case the **Collectors Edition (Imperial) Vendor** for the Mako Customization 7 item.
