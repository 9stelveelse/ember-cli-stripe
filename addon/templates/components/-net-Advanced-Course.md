Mosh (Moshfegh) Hamedani is a passionate and pragmatic software engineer specializing in web application development with ASP.NET MVC, Web API, Entity Framework, Angular, Backbone, HTML5, and CSS.He started programming at the age of seven on a Commodore 64 and fell in love with it. His dream at the time was to become a software engineer so he could create a tennis game for himself in 3D! So this inspired him to pursue programming both academically and professionally. He has a Bachelor of Sc... moreience in Software Engineering and a Master of Science in Network Systems. Whilst he never learned how to create a game, he has over 15 years professional experience developing web applications.Outside the software world, he enjoys photography, playing jazz piano, swimming, and latin dancing.Mosh is based in Melbourne, Australia.
 
This hands-on course examines how to utilize advanced features of C# and the .NET Framework in order to build sophisticated, scalable, high-performing applications. The course includes coverage of features available in .NET 2.0 through .NET 4.8.
 
The course begins by reviewing .NET's Common Type System, and then examines nullable types, inferred types and dynamic data. Advanced object-oriented programming topics include auto-implemented properties, inheritance, abstract classes, sealed classes, and generics, as well as how to implement many of the .NET interfaces in order to take advantage of .NET functionality.
 
Students learn how to use synchronous and asynchronous delegates to call methods using late binding, as well as how to use delegates to define and fire custom events and manage callbacks. The course shows how to build multithreaded applications and synchronize access to shared resources, including the Thread and ThreadPool classes as well as .NET 4.0's Task class and the Parallel Task Library. Coverage of the .NET 4.5 Async and Await features is included as well.
 
Students learn how to work with data in .NET's collections, as well as how to create and use custom generic methods and collections. Database topics include how to use ADO.NET to manipulate data in databases and how advanced ADO.NET features provide support for transaction management, connection pooling, and the management of disconnected DataSets. Coverage includes how to work with XML documents and make XPath queries.
 
The course includes the use of LINQ to make queries of data, regardless of its location. Coverage includes using LINQ to Objects, LINQ to SQL, LINQ to DataSets and LINQ to XML, as well as how PLINQ can be used to make efficient queries on large sets of data located in memory.
 
Students learn about .NET's support for n-tiered application development, including encapsulating functionality in private and shared assemblies. Students also explore how to create and consume WCF services to build distributed systems.
 
Other topics include: overriding System.Object methods; boxing and unboxing issues; when to use the String vs. StringBuilder types; working with data in other cultures (internationalization); and pattern matching using regular expressions.
 
The practice exam has a fair number of quesitons that expect us to be able to code/script actions, rather than use the Studio activities and their parameters.
Not coming from a programming background, I find it challenging to prepare for this, and there does not seem to be anyting in the UiPath Documentation Portal that covers it.
 
I have done quite a few of the courses previously on string manipulation, datatbales etc and use them regularly in my work. Unfortunately the practice exam has questions that frame these interactions as stand-alone scripts in what looks like VB.net or similar, rather than using the UI activites and parameters built into Studio.
 
One example might be constructing a script using dtclone() to clone one datatable from another.
If thee is somewhere in the academy I can find training on that sort of thing, and also where it would be applicable in e.g. a Studio activity. that would be immensely helpful.
 
Hi Graham
Thanks so much for your very detailed response.
Delighted to hear that you passed the exam and did so well.
Have done what you suggested and gone back over the some of the foundation courses.
Not as daunting now as it once seemed.
 
ASP.NET Core is several times faster than ASP.NET Framework. How did they do this? By removing all 'fat' from the request processing. Here you will learn how the configure the ASP.NET Core pipeline, and we will examine some of the built-in middleware.
 
ASP.NET Core allows you to pick and choose where to store your configuration. No more deploying configuration with production settings in source control! We will look at the idea behind this and of course how to choose your ideal configuration.
 
Proper logging is essential to find problems while developing and in production. .NET brings a unified logging approach which you can use anywhere in .NET and also works with your preferred logging framework such as NLog.
 
Building Single-Page Applications (SPA) is a very popular way of building applications on the web. Angular, VueJs, React and others can be used to build these, but they all require you to learn and use JavaScript and a whole new series of tools for developing these applications. But not any longer! Now you can use C# (and Visual Studio) and apply all those skills learned over the years to build SPAs with Blazor. Blazor makes building interactive client-side web applications efficient and fun that work on any modern browser.
 
So what will you allow your user to do? This most likely depends on the role the user has in your organization. This role is now represented with claims. In this chapter you will get a better understanding why claims are better than roles, and how claims are transmitted in a secure way as tokens.
