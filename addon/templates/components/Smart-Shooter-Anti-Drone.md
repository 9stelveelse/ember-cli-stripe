**SMASH Handheld** in hebrew: פגיון (Pigyon), is a high-tech fire-control system developed by the Israel-based company SMARTSHOOTER. The device is an external add-on solution that can be installed to most existing firearms.[1] The Israel Defense Force praised the technology and described the device as "groundbreaking" after its successful use in the 2023 Israel-Hamas War, claiming that *"it quadruples the forces"* chances of hitting their target, and thousands of it have already been used by the soldiers in the Gaza Strip.[2] In 2011, Smart Shooter raised 20 million dollars in a seed venture funding.[1]
 
When installed on an assault rifle, it uses an advanced artificial intelligence-powered machine vision to assist in aiming shots more precisely. The dual-core computer with ballistic processing can recognize, track, and engage aerial (drone/UAS) and ground targets with precision.
 
The system consists of a digital camera, a display for the shooter, a trigger guard, and a firing computer capable of locking onto a moving target, analyzing its speed, and environmental conditions (distance, wind, humidity), and estimating when and how a bullet fired by the shooter will hit the target with a 95% probability. SMASH locks on the target and tracks its movement to synchronize the shot release. When the computer identifies such a hit probability, it sends a signal to the shooter, marking with a red dot or a red cross on the sight display to allow for accurate aiming. The trigger guard prevents firing when the computer estimates a low chance of hitting the target. The sight's camera also records the shooting, allowing for operational investigation when necessary.[2]
 
The Modi and Dronebuster are both jamming systems, while the Bal Chatri detects the signals of potential enemy drones overhead. The Smartshooter, by contrast, is a rifle scope that calculates where to aim to take down fast moving drones.

The 82nd Airborne and 1st Cavalry received the same types of hand-held counter-drone devices the Army requested for fiscal year 2025: the Modi, Smart Shooter, Bal Chatri, and Dronebuster. The 1st Cavalry trained 80 soldiers on the equipment, out of its force of 19,500. It is unclear how many sets the units received.
 
As U.S. military bases in the Middle East face continuing drone attacks, Army leaders have praised Coyote interceptors as one of the most successful counter-drone systems. In January, the Army bought 600 Coyote 2C Interceptors for $75 million, at a cost of around $125,000 per interceptor.
 
Presented by the company for the first time, SMASH Dragon is an advanced robotic weaponry payload that can be mounted on different drones and other unmanned aerial platforms. It can incorporate various types of assault rifles, sniper rifles, 40mm, and other ammunition with great precision. Extremely lightweight and therefore allowing long mission endurance, SMASH Dragon integrates a unique stabilization concept with the SMASH technology that enables the system to accurately hit static and moving targets while flying.
 
SMART SHOOTER is a world-class designer, developer, and manufacturer of innovative fire control systems that significantly increase the accuracy and lethality of small arms. With a rich record in designing unique solutions for the warfighter, SMART SHOOTER technology enhances mission effectiveness through the ability to accurately engage and eliminate ground, aerial, static or moving targets during both day and night operations.
 
SMART SHOOTER announced that the United States Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory, through its Rapid Capabilities Office (MCRCO), has recently purchased several of its SMASH 2000 smart fire control systems for Test & Evaluation. The systems will be delivered this Fall.
 
SMASH Fire Control System (FCS) is an external add-on solution that can be integrated into any type of military rifle. Once the user identifies the target (independently or using the detection system guidance) and locks on it, SMASH tracks its movements and synchronizes the shot release to assure a fast and precise hit on the target. SMASH can be operated as a stand-alone solution as well as combined with other systems to provide an effective multi-layer defense solution.
 
Last November, SMART SHOOTER reached an important milestone in successfully completing the IWOO Critical Design Review. This means the IWOO design has been approved by IWTSD and will now move to prototype production with delivery of the first functional system next Fall.
 
The US Army and the Royal Netherlands Army recently conducted live trainings examining the Smash 2000 Fire Control System of Smart Shooter from Kibbutz Yagur (near Haifa). The system is mounted on small arms, and zeroes in on the target using AI-based image processing to assist the soldier to shoot more accurately. The US Army tested the system by firing on ground targets, while the Dutch army tested its drone-interception capabilities using small arms. Both armies characterized the exercises as successful.
 
RADA develops portable tactical radars that are used in anti-drones air defense systems, while Smart Shooter has developed a smart fire control system for small arms, which homes in on the target by employing AI-based image processing, and assists the soldier fire accurately. The two technologies are already in operational use by American forces as an anti-drones measure.
 
The DoD examined about 40 systems, of which only 7 were selected. It is difficult to estimate the volume of orders that both companies are expected to benefit from the program, as it depends on future budgeting and the procurment plans of the various military arms. According to a Congressional Research Service report, the DoD plans to invest at least $500 million in 2021 in research, development and procurement to implement the program.
 
Using a see-through display, the IWOO system automatically detects, highlights, and tracks potential targets, including drones. While the soldier has the smart weapon site active, an overlay on the lens will indicate the direction to aim to in order to hit even a small aerial target moving at speed.
 
Under the new five-year Framework Agreement, an initial 4.6 m order for SMASH sights worth up to 20m has been approved for delivery to operational readiness units across the Dismounted Close Combat (DCC) community by the end of this year.
 
The contract with the Yorkshire-based SME Viking Arms Ltd will enable the delivery of additional sights to dismounted close combat operators in the Army, Navy, and RAF over the next few years, based on operational and readiness requirements.
 
U.S. Army Paratroopers assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division aim Dronebuster anti-drone / anti-unmanned aircraft system (UAS) weapons on Fort Liberty, North Carolina, July 27, 2023. The Paratroopers trained on four counter unmanned aircraft systems (c-UAS): Dronebusters, Smart Shooters, Modi, and Bal Charti with oversight from civilian and military subject matter experts. This train-the-trainer event enhanced proficiency for defeating and defending against UAS across multiple formations. (U.S. Army photo by Pvt. Jayreliz Batista-Prado)
 
Offering day and night capability with automatic scanning and target detection, Smash Hopper is ideal for multiple mission areas including force protection, border security, anti-drone, remote ambush, and offensive action operations at complex environments. It can be mounted utilizing a standalone deployable tripod, a stationary fixed mast or a lightweight vehicle.
 
The SMASH 2000L/3000 is the lightest handheld operated fire control system using artificial intelligence, computer vision, and advanced algorithms making it an ideal hard-kill solution against drones and small UAS
 
News reports of December 8, 2020 revealed that the Indian Navy had gone in for an unspecified number of Israeli, cutting-edge fire control systems that tackle drone threats from close range besides improving a soldier�s accuracy and speed of hitting targets � the SMASH 2000 Plus system. The contract called for the supply of Smart Shooter�s SMASH 2000 Plus fire control systems, which would be installed mainly on AK-47 and AK-203 rifles. SMASH is a kind of electro-optic sight system. It was also reported that the Army and the Border Security Force (BSF) were also in talks with the Israeli firm Smart Shooter for possible procurements.
 
Recent media reports indicate that the US Army and the US Marine Corps have purchased variants of the SMASH 2000 computerised optical sight systems from Israel for counter-drone role in limited numbers. SMASH 2000L sights, with the �L� standing for �light�, are designed for use on a variety of small arms to facilitate more accurate target engagement; basically shooting objects with computer-aided precision. Smart Shooter is marketing its newest sight to non-US military customers as the SMASH 3000; which is referred to as SMASH 2000L/3000 to avoid confusion.
 
A statement release by Smart Shooter says that the systems would be deployed specifically as part of the US Army�s counter small unmanned aerial systems (C-sUAS) defence strategy, which Smart Shooter had been testing with the Marine Corps using SMASH 2000 sights since 2021. When SMASH first appeared with US special operations units in Syria in June 2020, what looked to be similar evaluations of the earlier system were also being conducted.
