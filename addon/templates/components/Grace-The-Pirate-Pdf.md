Granuaile ended up kicking him out and also took his castle. While at sea, she gave birth to his son, and was below deck nursing him when her ship was attacked by North African pirates who were overtaking her men. Grace put down her baby, stormed up to the deck, fired a musket, and soon conquered the enemy.
 
Again, Martina explained, there is no actual proof, but Granuaile was living on Clare Island in her later years, and the detailed, ornate plaque near the crypt in the Abbey has the O'Malley motto Terra Marique Potens, Latin for "powerful by land and sea."

Some will object to free grace right away, citing all kinds of verses out of context in the Bible that command us to be holy, perfect, obedient, righteous keepers of the Law. That's a problem. The Law's demands are impossible to keep, and we will never be justified by merely doing our best to keep them (Romans 3:20, Galatians 2:16, Galatians 3:11).
 
Then there are those who may agree and affirm the preaching and message of grace. But one glance at what really fires them up on social media will reveal a different tune. Their behavior exposes that deep down they hold to the concept that works are what is needed in order to justify and prove that you are a Christian. They are far more obsessed with the performance of the Christian than the substitution of Christ.
 
There were instances where Kings may have given a pardon or even a commission to Pirates to do piratey things. Or to be a Pirate to the enemy in a time of war. But, once this decree was made by the King, the Pirate was no longer really a Pirate, was he? This is a good illustration of what the Christian life looks like.

They were ruthless pirates and terrorised ships trading in Galway Bay, taxing all those who fished off their coasts. They traded with some coastal areas of France and Spain and built a row of castles facing the sea to protect their territory.

Grace grew up in an Irish speaking world, with her chieftain father Eoghan Dubhdara Mille largely left to his own devices by the English government. However, this was to change over the course of Grace's life as the Tudor conquest of Ireland gathered pace.
 
Because of her extensive travels and trade, she likely spoke some English, Spanish, Scottish Gaelic, and French as well. She was probably at least reasonably proficient in Scots, as she was particularly keen on recruiting Scottish sailors into her ranks.
 
It is known that she often wanted to join his fleets, but he always refused. Bunowen Castle, where she lived with her first husband, Dnal an-Chogaidh O'Flaherty, was likely the first base for her shipping and trade activities.
 
It is said that when Granuaile eventually met Queen Elizabeth in 1593 at Greenwich Palace after decades of fighting the English, she refused to bow because she was herself a Queen, and not a subject of the Queen of England.
 
In retaliation, she abducted the Earl's grandson and heir, Christopher St Lawrence. He was eventually released when a promise was given to keep the gates open to unexpected visitors and to set an extra place at every meal.
 
O'Malley informed Elizabeth that, in Ireland, a used handkerchief was considered dirty and was destroyed. Their discussion was carried out in Latin, as O'Malley spoke no English and Elizabeth spoke no Irish.
 
She is also recorded as saying to her followers: "Go mb'fhearr li ln loinge de chlann Chonraoi agus de chlann Mhic an Fhail n ln loinge d'r" (that she would rather have a shipload of Conroys and MacAnallys than a shipload of gold).
 
Over and over, Grace would harass his troops and he would take her territory, killing rebels, taking their land, cattle, and goods. He impounded most of her fleet. The time of the clans was coming to a close, and the fight was bloody.
 
In 1593 Grace went to London to talk to Queen Elizabeth to ask for her help. Grace was now in her 60s, but she had some fight left. She was hoping to persuade the English queen to help a poor defenseless woman (Grace!) against the mean old English troops and to receive some provision because she was a widow.
 
The two women were also very different. Elizabeth was pampered and doted on. She had never traveled or led men personally. Grace, of course, had traveled often, was used to the rough life of the sea, and had loyal sailors she could count on.
 
Bingham was convinced that Grace had gotten the better of the Queen and he fought the decision but finally gave in. In a surprise move, two years later Bingham was sent home in disgrace and imprisoned.
 
Lifespans were much shorter in the 16th century, and the average age of women at the time was 40. But Grace broke the mold in this way too. She outlived two husbands, was chief of her clan for many years, took up pirating again when she got out of jail, and was still active up to her 70s, dying in 1603.
 
**Acts of grace**, in the context of piracy, were state proclamations offering pardons (often royal pardons) for acts of piracy. General pardons for piracy were offered on numerous occasions and by multiple states, for instance by the Kingdom of England and its successor, the Kingdom of Great Britain, in the 17th and 18th centuries.
 
Mary Wolverston was pardoned by Elizabeth I.[1] Thomas Brooke was pardoned for piracy following the intercession of his sister-in-law (his brother being Baron Cobham) and his brother-in-law the Earl of Salisbury.[2]
 
With the end of the first Anglo-Spanish war under James I, and the corresponding end to English privateering in 1603, English sailors resorted to piracy.[3] In 1611, Captain Richard Bishop became one of the first notable pirates to be pardoned, having surrendered partly due to qualms about attacking English ships. He was allowed to keep his plunder.[a] Having retired in the pirate haven of Leamcon[5] near Schull, Munster, in 1617 he was accused of plotting with pirates.[6][7] Captain Thomas Tompkins also received a pardon around 1610.[8]
 
Following continued piracy by the likes of Peter Easton,[6][9] the English government was willing in August 1611 to offer a general pardon, on condition that pirates surrender their ships and goods.[10] With pirates threatening to accept offers of pardon from Tuscany and Savoy,[6] in 1612 the privy council of James I offered pirates a general pardon, also allowing them to keep their loot. At least 12 pirate crews surrendered to the general pardon,[6][9] including John Jennings[11] and the crew of Captain Baughe (who apparently sued successfully to keep his loot following its confiscation),[12] though a large portion of Baughe's crew would shortly return to piracy,[9] and Easton instead accepted a Savoyard offer in 1613.[9][13] Captain Roger Middleton, who sailed first to Ireland then to Mehdya to deliver the pardon, extracted bribes from pirates in exchange for their pardon, and encouraged pirates to delay their surrender in order to continue piracy.[14]
 
The lack of competing pirates in Ireland due to the general pardon saw Henry Mainwaring become notorious in 1613 as leader of a pirate fleet. He would receive offers from Tuscany, Savoy, Tunis and Spain of a pardon should he surrender; however, consistent with his not attacking English ships, in June 1616 he instead accepted an English offer of pardon for himself and his crew,[15][16][17] having sought one since the previous year[18] (as too had Lording Barry[19]). Also in 1616, Thomas Tucker (who sailed with Easton) received an English pardon.[4]
 
In 1623, John Nutt was arrested by Sir John Eliot,[20] having been tricked into negotiating the purchase of an expired offer of pardon.[21][22] Due to Nutt's connection with Secretary of State George Calvert, he was pardoned following this arrest.[20][21][22]
 
Mainwaring advised the king against pardoning pirates, opining that this encouraged piracy.[23] Clive Senior suggests that the government had an incentive to pardon pirates, since this would keep these potentially useful seamen available in case of war.[24]
 
In April 1677, the Jamaican Assembly passed an act requiring English subjects belonging to the island not to serve foreign states or princes as privateers without licence from the Jamaican governor. That July, the council ordered the issue of a proclamation giving foreign privateers one year to accept a pardon. On 1 August, Peter Beckford wrote that at least 300 privateers had submitted to the act.[28] However, some buccaneers did not submit, and some who had accepted the pardon returned to piracy.[29] A similar proclamation was issued in May 1681.[28]
 
Though James Browne was hanged in 1677, his crew of eight men was pardoned.[30][31] In 1682, buccaneer Thomas Paine accepted a pardon from the governor of Jamaica.[32] Jan Willems was made a similar offer.[33][34] Around 1684, Lynch tried persuading Laurens de Graaf to accept an English pardon.[35][36]
 
On 22 May 1687, James II renewed the proclamation for the suppression of pirates, offering a limited time in which any pirate who surrendered would receive a pardon. That August, he commissioned Sir Robert Holmes to suppress piracy in a squadron sent to the West Indies.[39] On 20 January 1687/8,[b] James II issued a proclamation (offering pardons to pirates who surrendered to Holmes or to an appointee of his) in order to ensure that colonial governors would cooperate with Holmes and his agents.[40][41][42] Holmes' fle
