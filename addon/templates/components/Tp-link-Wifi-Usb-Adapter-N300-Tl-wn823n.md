Hi guys im a new user of a raspberry pi 2
the problem i am having is i cannot connect to the wifi
i am using a tp-link tl-wn823n usb adapter
i have searched and can find loads relating to the raspberry pi 3
i was thinking that i need to install the driver for the usb adapter but can find no information on this set up using octopi..
any help that anyone could give would be great
thanks
 
i am trying to understand something which is completely new to me.
I'm sorry for not understanding..i have never used linux before and am finding it quite difficult
i have bought an ender 3 3D printer and it came with the raspberry pi 2 which i have managed to install octopi on it using a ethernet cable to connect to the internet.I thought it would be easier to use a usb adapter to connect to the wifi..i am now however thinking it may be easier for me just to use a long ethernet cable.
thanks

i bought the printer from someone and the raspberry came with it. if it is a problem to you to try and help me then don't..forgive my ignorance but i thought this was a forum where people could come for help..
thank you for your time!!
 
If you are unfamiliar with the RaspberryPi I would recommend that you get it going with Rasbian and use it as a computer. I used one for a while with TP-link wifi without any special drivers and it worked fine. Then when you are comfortable with it look on Youtube for a 'how to' load Octopi video. There are several good ones. It's not as hard to get Octopi working as you think. Good luck and feel free to contact me if needs be. Not everyone on here is an elitist.
