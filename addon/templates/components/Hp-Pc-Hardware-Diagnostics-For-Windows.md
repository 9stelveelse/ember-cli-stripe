Hardware Diagnostics is an application for diagnosing hardware issues that can provide a report covering a wide range of technical aspects and provide suggestions for resolving issues with both the hardware and the memory.
 
Hardware problems can typically show in the form of Blue Screen of Death (BSOD), system crashes, abnormal temperatures, or slow system response times. In a worst-case scenario, these unaddressed hardware problems can lead to total system failure.

The OS has a few native hardware diagnostic tools that we will show you how to use. In addition, PC manufacturers also add their custom ones. Depending on the ease of use and access of these tools, the process can be simple or difficult.
 
These tools can be OS-exclusive, PC manufacturer-exclusive, or even BIOS-exclusive. In addition, depending on the scope of these tools, they may be directed towards a specific hardware component or even all of them.
 
There are a lot of options for the best hardware diagnostics tools on PC that will offer free computer diagnostic tests. You can choose whatever option suits you. If need be, you can even choose to use multiple third-party hardware diagnostics tools.
 
BIOS/ UEFI is not as readily accessible as some of the other options on this list but is extremely useful in performing hardware diagnostics nonetheless. They are also the only option available for hardware diagnostics in case the PC fails to boot Windows.
 
If you suspect your computer may have an issue with failing hardware (CPU, RAM, etc), you can run their pre-boot diagnostics utility which tests your hardware without using the operating system. Other manufacturers have similar utilities, but the specific instructions vary.
 
I've since installed a new SSD and aftermarket RAM. The computer appears to be functioning normally (I'm typing this post on it), but I'd like to run the full hardware test to verify everything is OK.

But I can't seem to get it to load into the hardware test. I've tried holding down D before pressing the power button on as well as right before the grey screen comes up. I'm confused because I've done this before without any problems.
 
Same thing here (similar model MBP, same mods). Learned that Option+D does the trick. However, if you get what I see, the AHT fires up and then says that it doesn't support this model of machine. No funny business, it's an Apple MBP (no hackintosh here), but I added a OCZ Vertex 3 and I've tried pre-8GB RAM kit (stock) and post, no difference.
 
**Additional Information**
 Apple Hardware Test is included on the DVDs that are shipped with some Macintosh computers. If the copy on your hard drive becomes unavailable, use the DVDs to run Apple Hardware Test.
 
Had the same problem listed here on my iMac Pro, and it turns out that if you have a firmware password set, then the hardware diagnostics system won't work at all, and there is no indication of this, but a nice fellow named Felix from Apple was able to suss that out with me.
 
To disable firmware password or check its status, you need to restart the system while holding down Cmd+R. Note: If a firmware password is set, a screen will show and ask you to input the password. Once you do that, you're greeted with various options like Disk Utility or Install macOS. Ignore them and follow the instructions below:
 
The Apple KB article is inaccurate. After many unsuccessful attempts to launch the Apple Hardware Test on my MacBook Pro Early 2011 15",I discovered you need to hold Command + D during startup, not just D.
 
I ran into similar situation with my mid 2011 mac-mini (with non mac keyboard/mouse & aftermarket updated RAM). After pressing 'D' at startup it searches for internet, eventually asking to select wi-fi connection (no available connections displayed though). There's an option to specify wi-fi access point name & password but for me after putting the credentials the wait icon just kept revolving.Thankfully, I got it working using the ethernet cable.
 
I've had a similar problem whilst trying to run tests on a second hand Mac mini (Late 2014). I tried holding D, alt-D, cmd-D, cmd-R, alt-cmd-R, and two different wired keyboards, but each time the machine would just boot to the normal login screen.
 
Perhaps here, the SMC was holding onto network information from the previous owner and getting thrown by the different network environment in my house until it was reset. Disappointing there were no error messages if that is the case.
 
Mid 2012 MBP here. Just bought it and wanted to run AHT. Tried D, CMD D and OPT D, all bring same thing: "Internet Recovery". I have ethernet cable plugged in but it ignores that and wants wifi password (grr). I enter wifi password, then it connects but bugs out with black screen error:
 
When it comes to troubleshooting and maintaining the health of your Windows 10 system, running diagnostics is an essential practice. Diagnostics help identify and resolve issues, ensuring your computer runs smoothly. In this guide, we will explore the various aspects of running diagnostics on Windows 10, including the reasons to do so, understanding the diagnostics tools available, and advanced techniques for thorough analysis.
 
Running diagnostics on Windows 10 serves several purposes.
