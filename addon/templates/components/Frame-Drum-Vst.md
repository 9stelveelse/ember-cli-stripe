A **frame drum** is a drum that has a drumhead width greater than its depth. It is one of the most ancient musical instruments, and perhaps the first drum to be invented.[*citation needed*] It has a single drumhead that is usually made of rawhide, but man-made materials may also be used. Some frame drums have mechanical tuning, while on many others the drumhead is tacked in place. The drumhead is stretched over a round, wooden frame called a shell. The shell is traditionally constructed of rosewood, oak, ash etc. that has been bent and then scarf jointed together; though some are also made of plywood or man-made materials. Metal rings or jingles may also be attached to the frame. In many cultures [*which?*] larger frame drums are played mainly by men in spiritual ceremonies, while medium-size drums are played mainly by women. [*citation needed*]

LP Frame Drums were designed and crafted to honor traditional instruments with high - quality materials and craft. Our Bendir and Tar drums offer multi - ply Poplar shells with rounded thumb holes, synthetic heads, and tuning systems for comfortable play and long - term durability.
 
The Fiberskyn Frame Drum features Remo's pre-tuned technology providing warmth and projection when played with a hand or mallet. Constructed with an Acousticon drum shell and a pre-tuned Fiberskyn drumhead, these frame drums produce excellent projection and enhanced low-pitched fundamentals typically found with traditional wood shell drums, making them ideal for professional and Recreational applications.
 
Recently I decided to Build a rare percussion sample library to sell commercially as my firs product, a while ago a friend came to my studio and brought this Frame drum and he wanted to see how it will sound in a busy mix and I made him record few samples for me and I think it sounds good and unique and its my pleasure to share it with all of you.
 
This is a very simple instrumenet, and it is sampled perfectly. I certainly can ask for many other features, but that would be just pure greed. For example, it would be awesome to have some extra pitched-samples spread out, and only because this instrument takes pitches incredibly well!
 
One small tiny bug I found is that when you want to reset the pitch -by clicking ctrl+click on it- it goes all the way to the left instead of in the default middle. Nevertheless, I can't give this anything other than a perfect score. Well done!

As others have said, this is super well-made and performs a limited set of sounds really nicely. Good-feeling dynamics and space, a lot of fun to start a groove with. The UI has quite useful controls, though is a little big. Thanks for sharing this instrument!!
 
Im so happy this library was made with four dynamic layers and four round robins. i always feel like the extra effort is always worth it no matter what the library is and it definitely paid off here. This instrument has that really cool kind of hollow, resonant hand drum sound that will work great in many percussion contexts. The GUI looks really professional and well done. Well designed and functional. This drum is really fun to play with, is inspiring and very responsive to play on the keyboard
 
This drum was well recorded, and the GUI gives you some nice options to easily pitch it, remove reverb, and to dial in your sound with EQ. It's instantly playable, and very authentic sounding. It might have been nice to have some labels on the GUI controls, but even so, it wasn't hard to figure out what each control did. There are four velocity layers on each sample -- nice! This is a great, useful, musical, and highly playable library. I'm sure many people will find it very inspiring!

I get many emails asking about which frame drum for which situation and what is a good instrument to start with, here are some of my thoughts on the subject. All this is of course subjective and reflects my personal taste.
 
with the DRD tuning system, you can retune drastically to different pitches very quickly. That means you can accompany a song in D, retune and play the next song in C. This takes some practice and exact tuning is not always easy.
 
no matter if you play an open air gig and it starts to rain or if the spots on stage are switched on, the tuning of plastic skin drums is very stable. You can tune your drums before a concert and they will still be in tune when you start playing. As soon as you start performing this becomes a big issue. When I play a setup with tuned framedrums I almost exclusively use plastic skin drums. Also in studio situations the drum will keep the tuning for different takes. Recording in several takes with natural skin drums can be tricky because the pitch usually changes slightly.
 
There are different kinds of plastic heads, the ones I use are Renaissance, Weatherking and Fiberskin. All these are made by remo but also used on the Cooperman drums. Renaissance are half-transparent and have a golden/brownish color, Weatherking are totally transparent and Fiberskin heads are white with a surface structure that imitates natural skin.
 
For most situations in fingerstyle playing I like the rennaissance heads. These are very responsive, sharp and have a lot of overtones. Weatherking skin sounds a bit duller and for my taste overall a bit artificial, but on small/medium size bendirs these work great. Fiberskin heads consist of 2 layers of different materials, are thicker and have less overtones than renaissance which is sometimes nice in accompanying situations.
 
the more you touch or hold a drum, the more you affect the vibration of the frame which takes away from the sound. In the upright position this is not a big deal. You start to feel it in lapstyle playing and in the freehand position with the drum between your knees, the effect is even much stronger. For this reason and because they give more stability I like drums with heavy deep frames for lapstyle and freehand playing.
 
You are absolutely right and have beautifully shared the pros and cons of Natural Skin Drums and Plastic Skin Drums. Everything has some goodness in it. Similarly, every form of drums have some unique characteristics.Irish drum Bodhran is also very famous.
