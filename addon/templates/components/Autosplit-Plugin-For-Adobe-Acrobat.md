I have done all steps from official manual (inc. creation of coverage grid), but by not very clear reason I am getting 81 almost equal pages. On each page region is just slowly moving up. What am I doing wrong?
 
Ok, I want to clarify what I want to do. I have one huge map and I want to split it into submaps to print on small papersheets (and I want to specify its size by hand). Each submap should have its own frame with grid values, legend and so on. Or suppose you have detailed map of Earth and want print it like ordinary paper atlas. I think this can be done without working on each separate page. But I can't figure out how to do this in QGIS. But am not an expert:), I am just trying to create my first map for backpack trip.If this feature is not implemented, but nice to have, I can try to write a plugin if I have time.

If you're only interested in printing then map onto multiple A4 or A3 sheets then you don't need to do this in QGIS at all. If you have the A0 as a PDF adobe reader will allow you to split it and print it over multiple sheets?
