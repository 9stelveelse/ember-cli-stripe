*We are able to offer incredible savings on some products that are available factory serviced. Factory serviced items have been returned to the manufacturer for a variety of reasons including: returns to the retail store of purchase, items with a cosmetic blemish, demonstration units and items with slight defects. In addition, new items that are overstocks are labeled factory serviced. In all instances, the product is shipped to the factory, inspected, restored to original factory specifications if required, tested and repackaged. These products cannot be sold as new, so they are considered "factory serviced". Because of the rigorous inspection and testing process, the defect rate of factory serviced products is actually much lower than that on items sold new.*
