And idea is If you want you can remove Anydesk from the "SSL Decryption Exclusion" and test decrypting it and presenting the users with the trusted certificate as a workaround (they will not see the self signed cert in this way) just check also if the SSL decryption profile allows self signed certficates.

Could it be the old versions of Anydesk? since Anydesk got compromised a while ago they were breached and their certificate was stolen so they had to make a new one , so older versions have a certificate that were taken by hackers.
 
Good day, Dear @Marcos creating exclusion is not the proper approach. This was working without issue for last 3 years. This indeed started to generate warning only to one computer , mine since last week, been checking MD5 - seems legit and uninstalled/installed Anydesk again. Today started to see additional warnings to multiple computers of our network.

Thus this should be addressed by Anydesk - reputation / score system to be treated accordingly, not every single admin out there creating exclusions.
 
Creating detection exclusions for applications that are detected as potentially unsafe (PUsA) but were installed with administrators' knowledge is a standard approach to dealing with PUA and PUsA detections which are not enabled by default.
 
The reason for the detection as PUsA is due to the common misuse of AnyDesk by threat actors (specifically Ransomware gangs and their affiliates). It is not uncommon to see a threat actor place a remote desktop management software in an attempt to place a backdoor that is not using any form of malware. Since AnyDesk is commonly seen as a popular choice by threat actors, we have an optional PUsA detection. PUsA detections are off by default, and its likely that this option was enabled via Policy on your network.
 
Following our public statement on 2 February 2024 about a cyber incident at AnyDesk -statement-2-2-2024, we can assure you that we immediately took all necessary steps to investigate and mitigate the incident and continue to cooperate with all relevant authorities. All AnyDesk versions obtained from our official sources are safe to use. However, we recommend using the latest versions 7.0.15 and 8.0.8. The forced password reset for our customer portal my.anydesk.com was done out of an abundance of caution. We have no evidence that any customer data has been exfiltrated. Again, we also have no evidence that any end-user devices have been affected by this incident.

Transparency, company integrity and trust in our products is of paramount importance to us. However, it is the nature of a cyber incident that not all information can be made available at once. Therefore we have set up an FAQ section available at -incident, which will be updated to address our customers' concerns and to correct any false information that may be circulating about the incident.

In this case, I have updated the Anydesk program to the latest version, but the ESET program detects it as before. I would like to know what to do in this case. To be safe And if exclusion anydesk will there be a risk?

You can create a detection exclusion with the detection name via ESET PROTECT and ideally also with the path so that the tool cannot be run from a non-standard location, e.g. when dropped by an attacker for remote control.
 
I need to know the type of categories i have to add into services and applications section when creating a rule to allow anydesk in smart console. I have already added it as custom application/site with urls of \*.net.anydesk.com and \*anydesk.com\* and remote admistration with already defined anydesk. But it keeps disconnecting the user from anydesk sometimes but not always. Do i need to add more application categories to that particular section? if so what are those?
 
Is there some reason you cannot just allow the built-in application signature "AnyDesk" in your policy? That should cover all contingencies. Is it because you do not have Application Control enabled and/or licensed?
 
But in Web Filtering logs, it's full of hostname "AnyNet Relay" or URL "AnyNet Relay/" sometimes with non resolved IP or the classic boot-\*.net.anydesk.com or relay-\*.net.anydesk.com with Unrated Categorie.

are you using a Windows 11 VM hosted by Hyper-V? If so check if there is a session of anyone connected to the machine using Hyper-V. You should change the session option to basic session instead of enhanced session. This will help you connect with any desk. You have two ways of doing this:
 
I understood your problem and I just remembered it happen the same to me once but using a W10. I had several physical machines connected to the same firewall with same W10 version installed in all of them but for some reason in one of the machines anydesk wouldn't connect to the network. I didn't manage to fix that because I didn't really need it.
 
But I might have some thoughts about the trouble, if you ensure your network works properly (as you mentioned W10 machine works, I assume your network is fine too), then you should check that Windows Defender Firewall has the following entry rules:
 
The file was in rar format. The client told me to unzip it, so I did. The content was a PowerPoint application and an empty PDF version. I asked the client if I missed something, as there should be some sort of training materials included.
 
The client then asked if I have AnyDesk so he can help me open it. Instead of answering directly, I inquired about the contents of the file, so I could check if it's documents, videos, or PDFs for training, etc.
 
Hi, I got this same offer two days ago. Please keep yourself away from this they are scammers. You can check the client's history he must be having payment method verified but zero spending and reviews. If you successfully run that application your device will be hacked report that to upwork to yourself safe.
 
Hi , I've got the offer and I accepted that offer but after a chat with the client he suddenly insist me to download some anydesk software ? Now what will happen for the project , if he is fake , then he will give me a negative rating so how to find a solution ? please help me
 
Read the responses in this thread, especialy the one from Darryl B. There isn't any real job - the "client" is a scammer and the file is malware. Do not download it or apply for any "Facebook ads" projects. Report this person to Upwork by clicking on the three dots to the right of the client's message.
 
Another thing I would do is only work in a (VM)Virtual environment in case you install any miscellaneous programs that might backdoor a program/operating system, this way if your VM environment was corrupted by this file, you can delete the environment and run a backup.
 
I have tried using this script and I followed all the recommendations but when I run the script it only populates the custom field with anydesk: It never gets the AnyDesk 9-digit id.
Is this still a good script to use or am I missing something?
 
if this topic has been discussed before, I apologize for not finding it;
I installed arch on an laptop, enlightenment and anydesk. I only use startx without a login manager.
From what I understand, anydesk cannot run on a system without a login manager. So I installed the entrance. 
The problem is that I can't configure it. I tried all possible options by modifying /etc/entrance/entrance.conf, but after entering all the login data nothing happens, only the black screen remains. I checked and my session is x11, I also tried =248764, I checked /etc/pam.d/entrance according to the data from README. If I install gnome and gdm, anydesk is functional, but I don't want gnome, because I keep arch to a minimum.
 
Client which rely on filter 1 cannot be accessed via AnyDesk, as was before enabling the transparent proxy.
I tried also to allow the IP Addresses associated with Anydesk that i found on the squid access.log. Hope this will help someone.
 
Pessoal, boa tarde.. Estou utilizando somente E2guardian com proxy transparente, MITM, os bloqueios esto todos funcionando corretamente. Porm utilizo um software de acesso remoto chamado anydesk ele da erro, quando desabilitado o MITM, ele funciona...
 
I needed help to cancel a transaction. the paypal employee used anydesk app to control my computer to do this. Was this OK. He was able to see all my data and my bank info. Now Im worried about being hacked. I dont have any reason not to trust him just nervous. Has anyone ever had this happen?
 
Currently, our Customer Support teams do not offer the option to control your computer. I would recommend following the steps in the **"Safeguarding Your Account"**section in the following Help Center article: How do I spot and report a fake, fraudulent, or phishing PayPal email or website?
 
"We have revoked all security-related certificates and systems have been remediated or replaced where necessary," the company said in a statement. "We will be revoking the previous code signing certificate for our binaries shortly and have already started replacing it with a new one."
