We've bought into the Sony platform a few years ago and recently started shooting with the Sony a6000. The results have been amazing! Thus far Parachutist & Blue Skies Mag have published: 2 centerfolds, 1 full page, a calendar shot, and more than a dozen photos all shot by us with this tiny little camera! [A ton more and a cover since this was written]
 
I'm still learning the platform, but often get the question, "what are the best settings for skydiving?" Today, while testing out the Hypeye Alpha prototypes, I took a step back and wrote up this guide. It's the culmination of a lot of missed shots, other photographer's insights, my observations, and some research. Take this as a starting guideline and not necessary rules. Your conditions and settings may vary. Feel free to give us feedback and recommendations via email or Hypoxic's Facebook Page.
 
In Aperture Priority and Shutter Priority modes we would get inconsistent results. By manually setting our values, and letting the ISO automatically adjust, we get workable photos in most conditions no matter our orientation to the sun.

For sunset, sunrise, and overcast I'll take some practice shots on the wings during the ride to altitude. I the look at the histogram to ensure the setting spans the whole color line. 
(Press DISP multiple times to access the histogram)
 
ISO on a CMOS sensor is a gain setting. The higher the ISO, the noisier an image becomes. A lower ISO will reduce noise but at the cost of losing some information in the shadows. I like AUTO since it prevents completely lost photos due to exposure issues from the settings. It's recommended to set this limit from 100 to 800 for skydiving.
 
We've had a recommendation to increase the exposure compensation 1 to 2 increments when ISO is set to Auto. This should brighten up the faces and jumpsuits that are often dark in front of a blue sky. To achieve this, press down on the menu wheel and selecting +0.3 to +0.6. (+0.5 increments is also an option in the settings) 
Thx Kaspars Sprogis for the suggestion.
 
In a 24 Megapixel JPEG there is a ton of color information. We've found there is no need for sunny outdoor shots to record in RAW if you are going straight to customer. The resulting JPEGs have so much color information that post processing can still be done effectively especially. This is especially true if shot in a neutral or standard mode.
 
Camera's now days are fairly good at WB calculations. The auto setting seems to work fairly well for most conditions. Best part of leaving it to auto is I don't forget about it the next day after a night of party photos. With that said, we can always tweak the white balance in post if necessary.
 
Multiple people have recommended setting the WB to cloudy to make the images seem warmer throughout the day. This will compensate for too much "blue" in the image. Just remember to change it back when the lighting changes. We'll give this a shot.
 
I have an A6000 camera that suddenly is acting very strange. It will not allow me to make any adjustments in Apeture, Shuttter priority or Manual modes. Neither will it let me access the menu or even see pics already taken. I am at a loss at why this has happened as it has not been dropped or handled aggressively. I used it briefly on Monday and then on Tuesday evening the problems arose. I don't know what to do or where to go for help. I have been using your tutorials to learn how to use the camera so I decided to reach out for help. I have not down loaded any apps as I don't know how to do that nor have I updated any firmware. Oh I should mention in the auto mode like SCN or Intellegent plus it does take pictures although there is a slight delay or stickiness when shooting. I have been looking for a reset button to see if resetting would help but I have not been able to find one. So I am really at a loss on what to do next. (ps I live in Ghana so Incannot call Donys toll free number from here.
 
Please can someone help me,am seriously confused! I reset my sony a6500 since then QUALITY, SHOOTING SPEED and other operation not available. Please I need help,i will be be so glad if am out of this mess.
 
Just keep tapping firmly, pressing in a circular motion, pushing firmly and jolting the shutter button, with the camera off do all this. If its going to stay an out of focus broken piece of crap then its worth at least giving it some good firm taps, shakes, etc, worked on mine. Dont beat it, just give it some jolts.
 
Wow that worked! I could not get playback or adjust ISO. I smacked the top of the camera as described a month ago and didn't work. This time I did your suggestion tapping the shutter button in a circular motion in addition to giving it a few smacks. I was just going to list it on ebay as broken. A big thank you!
 
I had this problem and scoured many forums. Suddenly all the dials became unresponsive while shooting. First noticed playback button didn't work.. then it did ...then it didn't, for good. The only responsive interface was the focus select (center of dial) and the c2, set as zoom to focus to dmf/mf settings.
 
Menu, Fn, AEL, Play, etc, were not responsive, ONLY in shooting mode. The shooting mode dial was sometimes responsive, and EVERYTHING worked in menu mode (which was accessible when usb connected, or by jamming the menu button in the preview seconds after taking a shot)
 
A number of other forum threads hinted that the problem was the camera getting stuck in 'half shutter' press. The physical button was not stuck, but the camera was tricked into thinking it was in half-press mode, wherein it was only focusing and none of the other feature settings are available.
 
ifixit has a guide to remove the back and top panel on the sony a6000, very simple, just keep track of your screws as they are not all the same size. Once the top panel is removed it was clear that there is an excess of lithium grease on the switch mechanism, it's possible some excess has migrated into the actual switch on the pcb causing the issue. Essentially, the pcb switch is contacting in a way it believes the camera is in half-press mode when it's not.
 
With isopropyl and a cue tip, I carefully dropped some cleaner in an around the pcb switch. Just enough cleaner to permeate the mechanism but not to drip about the pcb. Quickly wiping any excess, I let it to dry for about 5min. I click assembled the panels (without screwing), put the battery in and tested, immediately 80% improvement.
 
Prior there was 0 response from rear panel buttons, now I could clearly see that it was 'sticking'. I could shoot and the buttons functioned normally most of the time, with some 'sticking' prevalent which was often remedied by lightly tapping the shutter button to jog it fully open again.
 
I've shot for a few minutes without 0 of the issue. Expect that it might pop up again but I know how to quickly repair it now. I removed some of the excess grease as well around the shutter / on/off mechanism, in case that was potentially the cause of the short in the switch.
 
One caution in opening the ilce-6000 was a smaller foam o-ring around what appeared to be the camera mic (located under the right side of the hot shoe when front facing) was difficult to replace as the adhesive had dried. I've left it out for now but seldom do video recording so don't expect any noticeable effect.
 
If you've found unresponsive of or sudden failure of the controls in shooting mode in your sony a6000 , a6300 , or NEX camera, I hope you find this guide and give a shot at repairs. It was very simple and saved me hundreds!
 
Please be very careful when you remove the top panel of the Sony a6000. Pay close attention to the ribbon that connect the flash. Carefully unplug it or secure it before you do anything else. I accidentally severed the ribbon connector from the circuit board, it was so flimsy...now I need to get a new camera!
 
After reading the great answers on here, I am inspired to at least buy the wd40 recommendation, but I'd also like to mention my simpler solution, that I decided to try after reading what the culprit was...
 
I banged the upper front of my camera (by the shutter button) with the bottom of my palm. It fixed the problem (at least for now), but wouldn't be surprised if it returned, as this hardly seems thorough. In a sudden pinch though, this worked for me.
 
After gently rubbing (in a circular movement) the shutter button and gently tapping the case next to the shutter button, my Sony a6300 started working again. Holding thumbs! Thank you Bradley and all of you.
 
Just wanted to come to this post and share what happened with me. I had the "half stuck" shutter problem, and not wanting to lose my camera for three weeks AND spend hundreds of dollars, I tried the contact cleaner from WD-40 for $16 on Amazon.
 
How I did it--take out the battery and memory card, spray the CONTACT CLEANER (not regular WD-40) into the little gap where you can get a liquid into the shutter button. I sprayed more than you would think, but not enough that it would be like pouring a liquid into the phone. I then pushed the button continuously to try to loosen up any dirt in the button. The first time worked a little bit (I thought it worked perfectly until the problem came back at about 100 shots and several lenses). The second time I did a little more and it's been just like new ever since (about 200 shots or more since then). I'll continue to post updates, but having seen this thread and trying the contact cleaner . . . I have to say try this first. It certainly didn't harm the camera and it was a lot ch
