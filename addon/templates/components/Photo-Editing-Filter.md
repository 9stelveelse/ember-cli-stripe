I haven't had access to photoshop in a few years, and I don't especially miss it because of Pixlr. I'm not exactly an advanced user of graphic design products, so I can't speak to that level... But for basic image editing and creation, this gets the job done.
 
Pixlr is used by our organisation as a cheaper and more accessible version of photoshop. We use it to create graphics for our campaigns, as well as posters, report covers and other visual content for our work.
 
I use the software as my go-to for quick photo edits and social media post creation. I've used this for so many uses for simple graphic editing that I can't imagine not having it for image resizing, editing, and social media content creation.
 
Pixlr is so far my best online photo editing applications. I can easily access it through my browser without having to download and install any application on my computer. It pretty much helps me do everything I would do with a more complex and advanced application like Photoshop.

This Pixlr application is one of the best photo editing software I have used so far.There are lots of unique features available and the best part of this application is it's clean and user friendly UI.
 
The autofix and autocontrast features are very useful when time is limited and you have edit multiple images. I use these features to automatically correct the basic adjustments and then tweak few parameters to get the images according to my taste.

**SnapSeed** is a great little iOS photo editing app. Along with brightness and contrast, it has the ability to alter "ambiance" which does a great job of lightening up shadows while still keeping a nice deep black.
 
Lightroom is probably more suited to editing the image the way you describe but you can certainly do it in Photoshop by using curves or more simply by level adjustments. However, I expect the equivalent you're searching for in Photoshop is Shadow/highlight adjustments.
 
You can make a flattened version of the image in Camera Raw. Simply open it as Camera Raw, add fill light, reduce noise, recover highlight clipping etc... The result is very different than with the curves tool or Highlight/Midtones/Shadows adjusting (which is actually the same as Curves, but limited). Fill Light is spatially frequency dependent, it saves local contrasts, curves do not.
 
I found the subject of the live lighting filter as the subject of a thread as recently as a week ago. @MEB sa
