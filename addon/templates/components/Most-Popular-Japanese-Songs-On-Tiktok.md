The Japanese music industry is not only one of the biggest music markets in the world, but a cultural phenomenon too which has resonated with people within and outside of the borders of Japan, especially since the 2000s which saw a stark rise in the popularity of Asian music worldwide.
 
Japanese pop is far from a monolith, it is a diverse landscape in which groups can explore genres such as jazz, rock and electronic music, and the popularity of the music has been accelerated by platforms such as Twitter and TikTok, in which the music can now be spread by listeners, allowing Japanese idols and groups to gain traction, which has had a massive impact on the Japanese music market.
 
The popularity of boy bands and girl groups continued to surge throughout the 90s and into the 2000s, where the Japanese music industry saw an influx of idol groups, along with developments in technology which made it easier for Jpop to be reached by a global audience.
 
The idol industry is centred around music companies recruiting teenagers and young adults and training them to be singers, dancers and rappers. The recruitment process, pioneered by Johnny Kitagawa (founder of Johnny & Associates), was then adopted by many other companies as a method of manufacturing Japanese idols.
 
The most prominent scandal that has emerged in the past year involves the pioneer Johnny Kitagawa himself; hundreds of victims voicing that they faced sexual abuse from the late music mogul. Having fostered the most famous boy groups in the country, this news created shockwaves in the Japanese music industry, with various Japanese idols coming forward and sharing their stories of abuse that they faced whilst working under his company.
 
Once an idol makes their debut, they begin to appear on music shows (such as Music Station, Love Music and CDTV) in which they can perform their new releases, television shows and hold in-person events as a means of promotion. A popular event in the Japanese music industry for idol groups specifically, is handshake events, in which fans can meet their idols and shake their hand in exchange for buying their albums. The more albums they buy, the more entries they get.
 
Idol groups such as AKB48 and Arashi, who debuted at the beginning of the 21st century continue to top the charts in Japan, proving the success and impact of the idol industry on the Japanese music market.
 
In order for albums to appear high on the Japanese Oricon Charts, they must have a high number of sales, both physically and digitally, and streams. However, there is a limitation to this method of charting. Sales that are shipped outside of Japan are not counted towards the charts, as a result of previous instances of foreign fans mass-purchasing albums in order to see their favourite artists chart.
 
Streaming on such services, along with Spotify for international listeners, has now become one of the most important aspects of the Korean music industry, along with buying the albums. Album sales, digital sales and streams land the songs on the Gaon and Hanteo charts (the equivalent of the Japanese Oricon chart) and their positioning is a determination of their popularity. This knowledge, paired with the numerous events that require the buying of albums as an entry, means that hundreds of thousands of albums, sometimes even millions, are sold within the first few days on release.
 
One of the significant differences between the Japanese music industry and the Korean music industry is their targeted audience. Whereas Korean music companies are usually focused on garnering worldwide attention for their artists, Japanese music companies are much more focused on building and maintaining the domestic fanbases of their groups, due to the size of the market within its own borders. In 2022, around 88% of physical album sales in Japan were domestic, with only 12% being international, mirroring the figures on the digital side.
 
Much like Japanese handshake events, fansigns are important promotional events for Korean artists, where fans can have their album signed by the art
