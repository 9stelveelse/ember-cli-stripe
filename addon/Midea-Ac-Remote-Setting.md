Before you begin using your new air conditioner, make sure to familiarize yourself with its remote control. The following is a brief introduction to the remote control itself. For instructions on how to operate your air conditioner, refer to the How to Use Basic Functions section of this manual.
 
**ECO operation:**Under cooling mode, press this button, the remote controller will adjust the temperature automatically to 24 C/75 F, fan speed of Auto to save energy (only when the set temperature is less than 24 C/75 F). If the set temperature is above 24 C/75 F, press the ECO button, the fan speed will change to Auto, the set temperature will remain unchanged.**NOTE:**
Pressing the this button, or modifying the mode or adjusting the set temperature to less than 24 C/75 F will stop ECO operation.
Under ECO operation, the set temeperature should be 24 C/75 F or above, it may result in insufficient cooling. If you feel uncomfortable, just press the ECO button again to stop it.
 
Keep pressing Fan button for more than 2 seconds to activate/disable Silence function(some units).
Due to low frequency operation of compressor, it may result in insufficient cooling and heating capacity. Press ON/OFF, Mode, Sleep, Turbo or Clean button while
operating will cancel silence function.**FP function**

Due to the unidirectional nature of IR remote controllers, this component cannot determine theactual state of the device and will assume the state of the device is the latest state requested.The assumed state can be restored at boot.
 
**use\_fahrenheit** (Optional, boolean): U.S. models of the Daikin BRC remote send the temperature in Fahrenheit, if your remote shows Fahrenheit and can not be changed to Celsius then set this to true. Defaults to false.
 
**use\_fahrenheit** (Optional, boolean): Allows you to transfer the temperature to the air conditioner in degrees Fahrenheit. The air conditioner display also shows the temperature in Fahrenheit. Defaults to false.
 
While they are identified as separate models here, the RAC-PT1411HWRU-C and RAC-PT1411HWRU-C arein fact the same physical model/unit. They are separated here only because different IR codes are useddepending on the desired unit of measurement. This only affects how temperature is displayed on the unit itself.
