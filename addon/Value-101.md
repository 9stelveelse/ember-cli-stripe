Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, recommended buying stocks when they were priced at two-thirds or less of their liquidation value. This was the margin of safety he felt was necessary to earn the best returns while minimizing investment downside.

Common sense and fundamental analysis underlie many of the principles of value investing. The margin of safety, which is the discount a stock trades at compared to its intrinsic value, is one leading principle. Fundamental metrics, such as the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio, for example, illustrate company earnings in relation to their price. A value investor may invest in a company with a low PE ratio because it provides one barometer for determining whether it is undervalued or overvalued.
 
Rather than mission statements, management directives, or corporate values printed on placards, organizational behavior is driven by peer pressure and behavioral norms that spread, like pathogens, through organizations.
 
**What does this program do?**
The Value-Added Producer Grant (VAPG) program helps agricultural producers enter value-added activities to generate new products, create and expand marketing opportunities, and increase producer income.
 
**Who may apply for this program?**
Independent producers (includes harvesters and steering committees), agricultural producer groups, farmer- or rancher-cooperatives, and majority-controlled producer-based business ventures, as defined in the program regulation, are eligible to apply for this program.
 
**How may funds be used?**
Grant and matching funds can be used for planning activities or for working capital expenses related to producing and marketing a value-added agricultural product. Examples of planning activities include conducting feasibility studies and developing business plans for processing and marketing the proposed value-added product. Examples of working capital expenses include:

A 2 minute overview of the Value Proposition Canvas, a tool for marketing experts, product owners, and value creators. This method from the bestselling innovation book Value Proposition Design is applied in leading organizations and start-ups worldwide.
 
Value types and reference types are the two main categories of C# types. A variable of a value type contains an instance of the type. This differs from a variable of a reference type, which contains a reference to an instance of the type. By default, on assignment, passing an argument to a method, and returning a method result, variable values are copied. In the case of value-type variables, the corresponding type instances are copied. The following example demonstrates that behavior:
 
If a value type contains a data member of a reference type, only the reference to the instance of the reference type is copied when a value-type instance is copied. Both the copy and original value-type instance have access to the same reference-type instance. The following example demonstrates that behavior:
 
You can use the struct constraint to specify that a type parameter is a non-nullable value type. Both structure and enumeration types satisfy the struct constraint. You can use System.Enum in a base class constraint (that is known as the enum constraint) to specify that a type parameter is an enumeration type.
 
Value capture strategies generate sustainable, long-term revenue streams that can help repay debt used to finance the upfront costs of building infrastructure, such as transit projects. Revenue from value capture strategies can also be used to fund the operations and maintenance costs of transit systems.

Value capture strategies are public financing tools that recover a share of the value transit creates. Examples of value capture strategies used for transit include: tax increment financing, special assessments, and joint development.
 
Studies have found that transit projects increase nearby property values by 30 to 40 percent, and as much as 150 percent where conditions are ideal. Transit projects likely to create the biggest values include:
 
Done well, value capture optimizes the benefits for both the public and private sectors. This requires close coordination to ensure that the transit investments are designed to maximize value creation and that the value capture strategies recoup enough funding for transit without creating disincentives for development.
 
Most value capture strategies are local matters. States establish the legal and regulatory framework for revenue/financing strategies, and cities and counties hold the land use implementing authority over revenue/taxing, business districts, and zoning, etc. Land owners determine the use of their land. Transit agencies, like any other land owner, must work with local governments to establish value capture strategies that use property and sales taxes, or development impact fees. The federal government does not have the legal authority to regulate local land use.
 
When transit agencies own land, particularly land acquired with federal transit funding, they can realize opportunities for transit-supportive value capture strategies. FTA plays a direct role in helping make that happen.
 
Joint development is a value capture strategy allowing a transit agency to coordinate with developers to improve the transit system and, at the same time, develop real estate in ways that share costs and create mutual benefits. Joint development creates revenue streams for transit that can be used to cover operating expenses and finance capital projects. For example, a transit agency might convert a publicly owned park-and-ride lot into a mixed-use development of offices and housing. When new FTA funding or land previously acquired with FTA funding is used for a joint development, it must go through an FTA approval process.
 
A wide variety of information and technical assistance regarding value capture is available to potential project sponsors. Please view the resources listed below or contact FTA using the information on the right side of this page for further assistance.
 
Section 215(b) of the National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA) requires that the initial purchase price or after-rehabilitation value of homeownership units assisted with HOME funds not exceed 95 percent of the area median purchase price for single family housing, as determined by HUD. Historically, HUD used the FHA Single Family Mortgage Limit (known as the 203(b) limits) as a surrogate for 95 percent of area median purchase price. However, statutory changes require the 203(b) limits to be set at 125 percent of area median purchase price. Consequently, PJs can no longer use the 203(b) limits as the HOME Program homeownership value limits (i.e., initial purchase price or after rehabilitation value).
 
**Newly Constructed Housing.** The new HOME homeownership value limits for newly constructed HOME units is 95 percent of the median purchase price for the area based on Federal Housing Administration (FHA) single family mortgage program data for newly constructed housing. Nationwide, HUD established a minimum limit, or floor, based on 95 percent of the U.S. median purchase price for new construction for nonmetropolitan areas. This figure is determined by the U.S. Census Bureau. HUD has used the greater of these two figures as their HOME homeownership value limits for newly constructed housing in each area.
