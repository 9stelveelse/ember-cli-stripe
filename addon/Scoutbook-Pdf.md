In order to access the Needs Purchasing Report in Scoutbook, you need to be a unit Admin (Troop Admin) or you need to have the Unit Advancement Chair role and Edit Advancement permissions to all Scouts in the unit (troop).
 
@ShannonPomp It looks like your Unit Advancement Chair and Troop Admin roles were ended in Scoutbook in July. I do not know the reason. However, another Troop Admin should be able to remove the end dates and re-approve the roles.

In Scoutbook, you need a Troop Admin (usually the Scoutmaster, Committee Chair, or Chartered Org. Rep.) to add you as a Troop Admin or as the Unit Advancement Chair. It usually works best if they add you as Unit Advancement Chair at my.scouting using:
 
I have again had someone switch me over in scoutbook and still no change. I used to have a key symbol next to my name and I no longer have that if it makes any difference. I tried to again load the report and it is still not functional.
 
I am trying not to be critical but you have got to get this working. Please begin testing your changes prior to deployment. Choose a small group of willing testers and then begin your rollout with them. Scoutbook is a production system and a lot of people depend on it to work. After your latest change I am unable to log in.
 
There was a banner message in Scoutbook for the past several days. The expectation was users would not have to clear their cache. This was supposed to be a seamless change. Obviously something did not work as expected. We are already communicating with BSA IT to try and get the issues fixed ASAP
 
@MarkOsbun - to clarify, there is no scoutbook android app. You may well be using a shortcut on home. Please delete that, clear the browser cache and cookies, then use scoutbook.scouting.org and click on login and create a new shortcut. This worked for me flawlessly.
 
@JeffreyBrandon - I have had no issues accessing scoutbook or IA2 on my newly imaged pc at work. As there were no cookies or cache saved from prior sessions I was able to go to scoutbook.scouting.org, click login and it worked. I am also able to hit the IAS link in scoutbook, then when IA click the scoutbook link and a new window for scoutbook opens. No issues here.
 
BSA IT is looking into the issues as we speak. The testing that was done on the test sties worked as expected. Updating systems does not always go as planned, and changing URLs involves more than just a code update.

@DebraWalker - one thing i want to clear up is that scoutbook does not date back to 1999. I know as I worked the Scoutbook booth at the BSA National Meeting in Atlanta in 2015. IA was then scoutnet and new. Now onto your request. The end goal will be to move scoutbook functionality to the new platform known as IA2.0. Prior to a singular advancement database it was noted to use scoutbook.scouting.org and data would flow in a sync. You could still just use IA but other features have not moved there. There is also a help section in scoutbook that runs through many of the questions you most likely have.
 
Debra,
I would become familiar with Scoutbook. Eventually, all the Scoutbook features will migrate to IA, but we are not there yet and when we move, it will be one by one, and in a way that you click on a menu item in Scoutbook that you get use to, and it will open in IA. So learn Scoutbook
 
If your unit has never used Scoutbook before, one of your Key 3 members, Key 3 Delegate, or Unit Advancement Chair, (these user roles are set in my.Scouting) should login and setup permissions for the unit. The unit advancement chair is defined...
 
**RED - Scoutbook.scouting.org**
This is Reception or the scouting Store Front. Everyone should be doing everything from here or going to Scoutbook first to access the other resources.
Scoutbook pulls from the other two, and brings it all together.
Advancement Tracking, Calendars, messaging, service logs, hiking/activity logs, payment logs, additional reports

Not sure if I am asking the question in the right place, was a little confused on this site.
I wonder who has switched from TroopMaster to Scoutbook, and is it better, any pros/cons? We are deciding, there are things we do in TroopMaster that we can not find in Scoutbook, although it may be that we just are not familiar enough with Scoutbook. Any personal experience to share would be helpful!
 
The only great thing about scoutbook is that is syncs with bsa advancement automatically. Otherwise troop master is much, much better. Scoutbook is very slow and difficult to use. There are so many changes to the site that happen so it can be hard to keep up.
 
Well we have been experimenting with scoutbook over recent months. We are hoping to move over to it eventually once some things are added and fixed, but for now we sync TM to IA. We have also tried out troopweb host in the past and it is very good except it does not generate reports for IA.
 
Is there a how to guide on connecting scouts to scoutbook via the parent? We have very low connection of scouts to scoutbook and are making a push to get everyone in. I have one motivated kid who wants in and the parent is looking to connect.
 
I have questions about how parents log in - which login info they use. Same for the scout who will be logging in for the first time. I want to avoid confusion and frustration. when they get to the SB login page, do they use their gmail, apple or my scouting.org info to login?
 
What happens with the numbers I supplied on the back end? Do you reset the connections? Is there something I can do to numbers from my connection? I suspect I will have the same issue several times over as I have commited families that have gone from my pack to the troop and have been connected to the units and the scouts for years without ever inviting their kids to join (because they were cubs) . So I f I can reset myself, then that should avoid a lot of down time and frustration. We are pushing to have all parents in and connected to scouts AND scouts invited to scoutbook by 8/15
 
Scout 1 logged in to Scoutbook today.
Scout 2 does not have a login ID but does have an e-mail address attached to the account. In this case, the Scout should go to my.scouting.org and create an ID there. This will then let the Scout log in to Scoutbook.
 
The question becomes, is the time spent using Scoutbook and the parent / scout access to data worth the tradeoff of Troopmaster being a more polished program with a monetary cost and no parent / scout access to data.
 
Having been a troop/pack master user cost was one of several factors that moved us to scoutbook. The limited access, over automated items, and the client/server framework platform all added to the move decision. Is troopmaster loaded with reports which we never used something that attracted users sure. I had a zero learning curve in our transition but perhaps I was lucky but under troopmaster there was notable need to help out leaders stuck.
The final decision is what ultimately works for your Units and leaders. It just was not a fit for us.
 
For some they focus on the de minimus aspects of one or two or even three dollars per Scout per year. So if finances are a decision making concern (as it is for some units) then SB wins hands down since it is free.
 
I can speak to the question from a different perspective. While I am currently a District Commissioner, not currently associated with a Unit, I use ScoutBook a lot as a Merit Badge Counselor. From that perspective, counseling 8 merit badges during the pandemic, the ability to sign off Blue Cards electronically has been fantastic. Once a Unit Leader selects me has a Counselor for a specific badge, I receive an email, set up a Zoom Meeting with the scout and a parent and go from there. As requirements are completed, I find it every easy to enter ScoutBook, look up the merit badge, find the scouts records and check it off. When the requirements are all finished, a sign the blue card in ScoutBook and off it goes to the Advancement Chair.
 
As advancement coord, my biggest issue with SB is you have to go through multiple screen loads for each requirement when transferring from the handbook to SB. In TM, all the requirements are on one panel, and you just tab from one to the next.
 
I know the idea is the Scout marks it done, then the SM marks agreement, then the Advancement person does the finalize tick, but getting the parent then scout to log in has been an impossible task when using TM (we even gave unit dues discounts a couple of years running and only got about 30% participation!).
 
If you are using TM right now, my biggest piece of advice would be DO NOT SWITCH AWAY! We made the switch from TM to SB a few months ago, and I would not do it again. TM is so much richer in features and reporting, not to mention has so many fewer bugs, that it makes the cost argument kind of silly in my opinion. Agreed with @TimothyMusson that SB makes my tasks as advancement chair 10 times (at least) as long as the same tasks in TM.
 
TroopWebHost DOES produce the IA2 file. Like Troopmaster, TroopWebHost provides a complete integrated solution, which for TWH includes accounting, budgets, JTE, fundraising, event management, calendars, advancements, public/private web pages, photos and document storage, and more. And their new mobile app is GREAT!
 
@ZacharyMcCarty - we were a troop/packmaster set of units. At that time there were few alternatives. They have a number of canned reports that deal with unit management. At one point they advertised being scoutnet certified. There were also a
