Anglers can use the commenting features in the Apple App Store or Google Play Store to provide feedback, which will help the department make improvements to the app over time. The public can also leave comments at MobileAppDev@dfw.wa.gov.
 
The new version of Fish Washington was written with a single code base for both iOS and Android platforms. This means a smaller app size, less frequent updates, and fewer bugs. Using a single code base, Flutter (an open-source platform that is free to use), also reduces the time and cost to develop new features by around 75% rather than using native iOS and Android languages.

Fragments are a part of the GraphQL specification that allows you as a developer to break out parts of your queries into smaller, reusable, chunks. These can be thrown in wherever they are needed in your queries. This is neat, as it can help you reduce the overall footprint of your application and reduce the amount of code. Less code, less surface area for bugs.
 
Neat. What this code snippet does is to find some kind of post entity, the text that this post contains, and then it finds the author of that this post. The author is of the User type, and whenever we want to display an author, we can use this userDetails fragment.
 
**Why?** As useful it might at first seem, this locks the schema into the naming of the UserRecordConnection, as the fragment is tied to this type. It also hides some goodness that GraphQL provides, such as being able to use the potential metadata in edges.
 
If you had relied on the userList fragment here, you would then have to extend the userList fragment with that metadata. Does the userList name make sense now? Or should it be userSearchList? Can you reuse that very specific fragment? Or is would it be better to perhaps put the search metadata into a searchMetaData fragment?
 
But then you want a third way of displaying your posts. This time, only an excerpt of the text should be used, without the image, comments, and when it was posted, but this time, you want the likes information. Should you now introduce a third God-like fragment? No. You should split your fragment up, and compose your query using multiple fragments.

There is nothing new about humans and all other vertebrates having evolved from fish. The conventional understanding has been that certain fish shimmied landwards roughly 370 million years ago as primitive, lizard-like animals known as tetrapods. According to this understanding, our fish ancestors came out from water to land by converting their fins to limbs and breathing under water to air-breathing.
 
However, limbs and lungs are not innovations that appeared as recent as once believed. Our common fish ancestor that lived 50 million years before the tetrapod first came ashore already carried the genetic codes for limb-like forms and air breathing needed for landing. These genetic codes are still present in humans and a group of primitive fishes.
 
This has been demonstrated by recent genomic research conducted by University of Copenhagen and their partners. The new research reports that the evolution of these ancestral genetic codes might have contributed to the vertebrate water-to-land transition, which changes the traditional view of the sequence and timeline of this big evolutionary jump. The study has been published in the scientific journal Cell.
 
"The water-to-land transition is a major milestone in our evolutionary history. The key to understanding how this transition happened is to reveal when and how the lungs and limbs evolved. We are now able to demonstrate that the genetic basis underlying these biological functions occurred much earlier before the first animals came ashore," stated by professor and lead author Guojie Zhang, from Villum Centre for Biodiversity Genomics, at the University of Copenhagen's Department of Biology.
 
A group of ancient living fishes might hold the key to explain how the tetrapod ultimately could grow limbs and breathe on air. The group of fishes includes the bichir that lives in shallow freshwater habitats in Africa. These fishes differ from most other extant bony fishes by carrying traits that our early fish ancestors might have had over 420 million years ago. And the same traits are also present in for example humans. Through a genomic sequencing the researchers found that the genes needed for the development of lungs and limbs have already appeared in these primitive species.
 
Using pectoral fins with a locomotor function like limbs, the bichir can move about on land in a similar way to the tetrapod. Researchers have for some years believed that pectoral fins in bichir represent the fins that our early fish ancestors had.
 
The new genome mapping shows that the joint which connects the socalled metapterygium bone with the radial bones in the pectoral fin in the bichir is homologous to synovial joints in humans -- the joints that connect upper arm and forearm bones. The DNA sequence that controls the formation of our synovial joints already existed in the common ancestors of bonefish and is still present in these primitive fishes and in terrestrial vertebrates. At some point, this DNA sequence and the synovial joint was lost in all of the common bony fishes -- the socalled teleosts.
 
Moreover, the bichir and a few other primitive fishes have a pair of lungs that anatomically resembles ours. The new study reveals that the lungs in both bichir and alligator gar also function in a similar manner and express same set of genes as human lungs.
 
At the same time, the study demonstrates that the tissue of the lung and swim bladder of most extant fishes are very similar in gene expression, confirming they are homologous organs as predicted by Darwin. But while Darwin suggested that swim bladders converted to lungs, the study suggests it is more likely that swim bladders evolved from lungs. The research suggests that our early bony fish ancestors had primitive functional lungs. Through evolution, one branch of fish preserved the lung functions that are more adapted to air breathing and ultimately led to the evolution of tetrapods. The other branch of fishes modified the lung structure and evolved with swim bladders, leading the evolution of teleosts. The swim bladders allow these fishes to maintain buoyancy and perceive pressure, thus better survive under water.
 
"The study enlightens us with regards to where our body organs came from and how their functions are decoded in the genome. Thus, some of the functions related to lung and limbs did not evolve at the time when the water-to-land transition occurred, but are encoded by some ancient gene regulatory mechanisms that were already present in our fish ancestor far before landing. It is interesting that these genetic codes are still present in these 'living-fossil'' fishes, which offer us the opportunity to trace back the root of these genes," concludes Guojie Zhang.
 
Primitive fish and humans also share a common and critical function in the cardio-respiratory system: The conus arteriosus, a structure in the right ventricle of our heart which might allow the heart to efficiently deliver the oxygen to the whole body, and which is also found in the bichir. However, the vast majority of bony fish have lost this structure. The researchers discovered a genetic element that appears to control the development of the conus arteriosus. Transgenic experiments with mice showed that when researchers removed this genetic element, the mutated mice died due to thinner, smaller right ventricles, which lead to congenital heart defects and compromised heart function.
 
Naumann wanted to know the minimum number of neurons required to build such a circuit. Working with Harvard colleague James Fitzgerald for about six months, she was determined to find the minimal model that could explain the behavior.
 
In a corner room with blacked-out windows, dominated by a cube of black draping, postdoctoral researcher Maxim Nikitchenko is using his background in physics to fine-tune an innovative, purpose-built microscope. Boxes of fasteners and hand tools are strewn across almost every surface.
 
Duke Neurobiology is a great home for Naumann because many of its investigators are also system neuroscientists like her, she said. She joined Duke in 2018. Earlier this year, she received a prestigious Alfred P. Sloan Foundation two-year fellowship for being a pathbreaking young scientist.
 
Sitting in front of an array of three computer screens, each of which is split into many panels of fish video, lines of code, and data plots, graduate student Matt Loring is writing and validating the code that turns all these split-second observations into interpretable data.
 
With that limitation in mind, Naumann is considering adding another kind of fish to her studies: Danionella translucida, a dwarf relative of the zebrafish from Myanmar that, amazingly, has an open patch at the top of its skull even in adulthood, giving neuroscientists a literal window into the mind.
 
It may seem odd to devote all this attention to a pinprick of brain tissue in a tiny fish, but the tools and techniques the group is establishing and the deeper understanding of neural circuitry they will reveal create a foundation for subsequent investigation.
