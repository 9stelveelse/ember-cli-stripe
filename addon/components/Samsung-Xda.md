Samsung Electronics America, Inc., in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), announced a voluntary recall of certain top-load washers manufactured between March 2011 and October 2016.
 
The voluntary action was driven by reports highlighting the risk that the drums in these washers may lose balance, triggering excessive vibrations, resulting in the top separating from the washer. This can occur when a high-speed spin cycle is used for bedding, water-resistant or bulky items and presents an injury risk to consumers.
 
As an added safety measure, all known washer owners will also receive a Home Label Kit in the mail. The kit will include a new control panel guide, two warning labels and step-by-step instructions for applying them to the machine, and a user manual supplement.
 
Until the repair is completed, the washer exchanged, or the Home Label Kit applied, Samsung and the CPSC are advising owners of the recalled washers to use the delicate or waterproof cycles when washing bedding, water-resistant or bulky items.
