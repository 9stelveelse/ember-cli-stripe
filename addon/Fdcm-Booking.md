We booked our plane tickets to Nagpur in January as Indigo was giving an amazing round trip offer of around INR 5,800. After intensive googling, I zeroed in on **Serai Tiger**for our lodging. However I learnt later that we should have started the process by first booking our safaris. The booking system here is totally different from the African safaris! Thankfully, by various permutations and combinations of entries through different gates, the camp manager Mr Dev booked us 6 safaris.
 
After dinner, my friend told us that many beautiful birds visited the garden in front of her balcony early in the morning. We made a mental note of it but did not take her so seriously as we probably thought how many birds can visit this concrete jungle?

After a sumptuous home-made dosa breakfast, we left for Tadoba in the big van sent to us by the lodge. The roads were smooth and we reached in time for lunch (very good taxi driver Prakash Dungre +91 9423404693) and soon got ready for our first safari. We had been warned about the deadly heat in that part of the country but had also been assured that in early April, the heat will be bearable. However, while driving to Mohurli gate in an open Gypsy, we felt we were passing through a furnace. Our hats and sunglasses hardly provided any relief. The jungle did not provide a canopy either and we got roasted almost until sunset. Looking at the headgears of the other tourists, who were all dressed up as the infamous bandits of the Chambal Valley, we all realised that we had made a BIG mistake in our estimation of heat. But our excitement and very good sightings made us forget the heat for a while. More about the beautiful forest and its flora and fauna in my next post.
 
Safaris can be booked by you online at this site. Bookings are open 120 days in advance but they go away very quickly. However, some resorts do it for you at a nominal charge. A safari costs about Rs 3500 per jeep. Not person. Keep some cash with you.
 
MTDC and FDCM guest houses are the best located and cheapest places to stay with all **basic** amenities. However, food options are very limited. They only have online booking facilities. Do not try to call them.
 
**Royal Tiger Resort** is another very affordable place right next to Mohurli gate. It is a favourite haunt for photographers. There are other resorts too to suit your budget needs. Check this site for very comprehensive information on TATR.
 
At the Kolara gate, the most famous high end resort is **Svasara** but Chava is much more reasonable and very good, according to my friends who have stayed there. Their food is very good too but 100% vegetarian. The biggest plus of this gate is that it is much much quieter than the very touristy and noisy Mohurli.
 
**Nagpur**: Visiting the Gorewada International Zoological Park in Nagpur for Safari will now be a costly affair as the tourists will have to pay more from November 15. The Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM) has decided to restore the original fare structure.

When the Indian Safari, spread over 115 hectares, was inaugurated on January 26, 2021, the fares were kept at Rs 300 per person on weekdays, and Rs 400 on weekends and public holidays when there is a huge rush.
 
According to reports, from November 15, for air-conditioned buses, visitors will be charged Rs 300 on weekdays plus a convenience fee (payment gateway charges), and Rs 400 on Saturdays and Sundays, and public holidays. Similarly, Rs 200 will be charged for canters on weekdays and Rs 300 on weekends.
 
The park is closed on Mondays for maintenance. The FDCM has appealed to visitors to go in for online bookings to avoid last-minute disappointment. There is a consistent rise in the number of tourists as compared to last year. A month-wise comparison shows that the number of visitors has gone up in 2022 by over 6,000 every month as compared to 2021.
 
However, concessions for students will continue. School students will get 50% concession and college students 25% on weekdays only. Besides, coaching classes, homes for the aged, orphanages, and education institutes for divyangs will also get sops, the reports said.
