If there's one celebrity synonymous with the gym, it's Arnold Schwarzenegger. However, the muscle-bound bodybuilder turned Hollywood star recently released a workout challenge that foregoes heavy weights and exercise machines entirely. In fact, it doesn't require any equipment at all.

Intrigued, I signed up to his newsletter (The Pump Daily) and quickly received an email containing details of the workout. Given Schwarzenegger's formidable physique, I was surprised by just how accessible it was, so resolved to take it for a spin myself.
 
For the intermediate version (aimed at people with two years of consistent training under their belt) he advises beginning with 10 repetitions of each exercise, and if you're a beginner, Schwarzenegger suggests starting with sets of five.

He also recognises that learning how to do a push-up can take time, so he says you can make this exercise easier if needed by lowering your knees or placing your hands on a raised surface like a chair.
 
As a fitness writer, it comes with the territory that I try to keep myself in fairly good shape. Health is, of course, a major motivator to do this, but my main reason for donning my trainers on a daily basis is that I love the feeling I get from moving my body.
 
Whether I'm cycling around my neighborhood, hiking up mountains, lifting weights, trying to master gymnastic movements or racking up the miles on my rowing machine, I like to think I can tackle most activities. Yet, Schwarzenegger's session was far more challenging than I imagined.
 
"Great," I thought. "That's the largest and, by extension, hardest sets out of the way." How wrong I was. By the time I'd reached the sets of nine, I was feeling the full effects of 65 push-ups and lunges, and I was only just over halfway through.
 
While it is undoubtedly different to his hours-long workouts of old, Schwarzenegger's reason for sharing this session is simple: to "cut through the noise and make sense of the world of fitness, nutrition, and wellness". This, he hopes, will help more people develop healthy habits.
 
I was a big fan of how he created a session that can be completed by anyone, with scalable elements to suit all fitness levels. The fact it's short and you don't need any equipment to give it a go are welcome bonuses too, as I was able to give it a quick go in my living room during my lunch break.
 
Yet, in spite of its stripped back nature, it was still able to offer a fun challenge that worked my heart, lungs and muscles in one fell swoop. Going against the clock also adds a competitive element, and means you can go back to the session at a later date to try and better your score.
 
So, if you're after a quick workout challenge, I definitely recommend taking on The Countdown. Just don't expect an easy ride! This session works several body areas, but consider adding this time-efficient 10-minute core workout to your routine too.
