Recently we bought new, more powerful equipment for our data center. Now it's set and ready to go. Password-Find will work faster from now on and with improved cracking speed we can find passwords we couldn't before.
 
Google Password Manager is built in to Chrome web browser and Android devices, which means you don't have to install it. In Chrome, just turn on sync. And in Android, select Google as your autofill service by going to Settings, searching for "autofill service", and making sure that "Google" is selected.

We protect your data with advanced security. Google services, like Chrome, have security built in. Which means that you're protected from harmful sites, malware, and other threats. With Google Password Manager, your passwords are protected and encrypted. Plus, we've built privacy tools that put you in control of how your data is used.
 
AFAIK no serious email client stores accounts passwords.
If you have forgotten your ISP account password for eM Client, then you should go to your ISP website and ask to reset that password. Then update that in eM Client.
 
If you are using oAuth, typical with Gmail, there is no password used in eM Client. Access to your Gmail account will continue regardless of how many times you change the password on the server. You do not need to change anything in eM Client.
 
Thank you.
Mysteriously my phone did pick up the eMClient emails today. It must have pulled the information from my old phone in the transfer but took a long time to process as it also did with se3veral other programs.
I was at the interface page originally and it appeared that I could change the password there but I was apprehensive about doing it. Thanks again.
 
How Chrome saves your passwords depends on whether you want to store and use them across devices. When synced, you can use passwords on Chrome on all your devices, and across some apps on your Android devices.
 
Bitwarden does have a password history for each vault item, which stores up to 5 previously saved passwords. All you have to do is to open the login item for viewing (not editing) and scroll to the bottom, where you will see:
 
(the number indicates how many entries are currently stored in the history). Click on the number (e.g., on the **5** in the above example), and it will display the previous passwords for that vault item (with timestamps).
 
It is possible for an item to be updated without changing the password (for example, if you modify the item name, username, URLs, notes, custom fields, etc.). If the item password was changed, then there would be a Password history entry shown below the timestamps.
 
I do not understand why this is so much hidden! Why not have, under or next to the password field itself - where this belongs - a clear link Password History ?
And why limited this to when one is not in edit mode: it is precisely when one is in edit mode, trying to look at the password that is not there or not the correct one that the password history is needed.
 
When I run **gvmd --user=admin --new-password=new\_password** this command nothing is printing in the terminal but when I log in with the new password it is showing **Login Failed, invalid username or password** warning message.
 
If you can find a password I would have very serious doubts of the security of the corresponding application. You need to write down that displayed password. If you lost that password you need to create a new one with the command above.
 
We are installing open-vas in our local host & by default that random password is generated & displayed in the terminal after the setup so my suggestion is somewhere if you store the password it will be easy to pick that.
 
I left my old job a few years back and wanted to check a few of my old pdf payslips but for the life of me I can't remember the password.I've tried using John The Ripper in incremental mode because I do know it wasn't a complicated password (I never changed the one they provided me when they setup Sage as I never saw the need) but despite running for over a day it still hadn't found it.
 
I was pretty sure it was just the first part of my email address (let's call is abcchji) followed by, or perhaps preceded by a series of numbers. There may have been a single capital in it too at the start.
 
I want John the search solely for the string abcchji, but with John then trying random strings of numbers (0-9) and symbols (nothing exotic, maybe a ! or #, the passwords for everyone were set up together so I don't remember it being too difficult to remember until I didn't use it for 4 years)
 
You can create your own JtR rules to generate your wordlist.  
Create a local john-local.conf file in your working directory, so JtR will include it, giving you the option to run rules defined therein:
 
Its whatever the password is you, or someone, set up in your JSS under **Global Management >> User-Initiated Enrollment >> Platforms >> OS X**. There are Username and Password fields there that you use to set up an account to be created when doing the enrollment.
 
If you don't know what you entered, you'll need to reset it there. For any Macs that are already enrolled, you should be able to set up a Management Account payload in a policy that resets the password to something else.
 
Can you confirm the management account that get's created is a local account on the computer with administrative privileges? If it's just some other type of account only JAMF can use and it's not any sort of security hole to simply abandon that old account, then I'll just ignore it.
 
Its a regular local admin account on the Mac. Nothing special about it. They can and often are created as "hidden" which puts their home directory in /private/var/ but deleting an account from dscl always uses the /Users/ path regardless of where the actual home directory is. But, you may need to go and remove the actual home directory as well once you locate it. Deleting it from dscl only removes the local directory services record, not the home folder.
 
Yep, pretty much. If security is an issue here, then you'll want to remove it. but.. since even you don't know the password for the account, what are the chances anyone else would? I guess I'm saying I don't see it as a huge risk, but that's your call on whether its worth just leaving it alone.
 
Here's what I might do about it. The JSS knows what the account name and password is for Macs enrolled with that account. It has to or it can't actually manage the Mac in some respects. So, set up a policy that deploys a new QuickAdd.pkg to any Macs using that old management account to get them enrolled with a new management account that gets created in the QuickAdd. Then later set up a policy that will remove the old management account, so you only have the one on there.

I tried to get access to my bitbucket account from VSCode and JIRA Plugin. You need a git password for this. In the simplest case this would be my JIRA password. But unfortunately I don't have one, because my Jira account is based on OAuth2 with google. Where on bitbucket I can now see the password I need.
