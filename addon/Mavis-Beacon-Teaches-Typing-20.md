Its pretty cool that u got to be involved in that. Was that really genuine dalmation fur? I didnt know they even did that. I thought it was just Cruella Deville (spelling?) that used dog fur. Id get mad about it too but I wouldnt make a computer program discontinue just because of a picture. I never would have guessed it was real if I hadnt been told. Oh well. Thanks for the entertaining reading! ?
