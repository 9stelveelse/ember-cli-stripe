Not Inside a VM - You cannot run a VM-accelerated emulator inside another virtual machine, such as a VirtualBox or VMWare-hosted virtual machine. You must run the emulator directly on your system hardware.

You have vCenter and vSphere Web client use this to edit the VMs config Right click the Your\_Windows\_GuestOs > Edit Settings > CPU > Check the box "Expose hardware assisted virtualization to the guest OS.
 
Since my machine was slow with Android Studio I created a virtual machine on windows server on AWS with the best processor and RAM configurations, which gave me seamless programming and execution experience. But to use the emulator I face the error listed below.
 
I have android emulators running inside VMWare guest. It is utilizing Windows and not Linux, but the principles apply. As has been mentioned, the biggest item is ensuring the the VMWare processor setting for virtualization is checked.
 
Android is a very popular and prolific operating system on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Most of the time, there is no practical reason to install Android on a physical computer, but there may be some cases when you need to run Android on a virtual machine (VM), for example, when developing applications for Android and testing them. Fortunately, you can install Android on VMware Workstation, VMware Player, VMware ESXi, and VirtualBox.

Once you install Android on VMware Workstation or ESXi, you will get all features available for Android installed on a smartphone. The advantages of using an Android VMware VM include the possibility of creating snapshots and cloning a VM during the development or testing process. This blog post explains how to install Android on VMware ESXi step by step with screenshots.

First, download the Android installation image. In this example, we are using the 64-bit version of Android Oreo (the third release). While the ARM and ARM64 architecture is used on most smartphones and tablets, the image applied in this example is ready for devices using the x86-64 architecture. You can also see all available images for different architectures on the official web site of the Android project.
 
Open VMware vSphere Client in a web browser, go to **Storage**, select a datastore connected to the ESXi host on which you plan to install the VMware Android VM, select the Files tab, and upload the installation ISO image to the selected datastore (click Upload Files and select the needed file). In this example, the android-x86\_64-8.1-r3.iso file is uploaded to the SSD2 datastore that is connected to the ESXi host whose IP address is 10.10.10.74.
 
**4. Select storage**. Select a datastore in which to store the configuration and disk files of the Android VMware VM. You can leave the default value for the VM storage policy. If you see the compatibility checks succeeded message, go to the next step of the wizard.
 
**5. Select compatibility**. Select the required hardware version for your Android VMware VM. The higher the VM version you select, the better VM performance you get. The newest VMware features are available for the latest hardware versions of virtual machines. The Android version that is installed on VMware ESXi in this example is compatible with ESXi 6.5 VM hardware version. Hence, ESXi 6.5 and later is selected as the virtual hardware version.
 
**6. Select a guest OS**. A selected guest operating system allows the wizard to provide the appropriate default VM settings for installing an operating system. As Android is based on a modified Linux Kernel version, you can select Linux as the guest OS family. The guest OS version may be selected as Other 3.x or later Linux (64-bit). If you wish to install a 32-bit version of Android on a VMware VM, select the appropriate (32-bit) version of the guest OS.
 
In the New CD/DVD Drive settings, select the Datastore ISO file option in the drop-down menu, select the Android ISO installation image file (android-x86\_64-8.1-r3.iso that was uploaded to the ESXi datastore in this case), and tick the Connect At Power On checkbox. Other settings may have default values.
 
After creating a new virtual machine, power on the VM and boot from the virtual ISO image (android-x86\_64-8.1-r3.iso) you selected to use by a virtual CD/DVD drive during the Android VMware VM creation.
 
When the Boot flag is set for the partition, write changes to the disk. Navigate to the **Write** option and press **Enter**. After that, you will see the question: Are you sure you want to write the partition table to disk? (yes or no)
 
Now the Android VMware VM is booted and you can see the graphical user interface of Android. Select your preferred language and hit **Start**. In this walkthrough, English (United States) is used.
 
On the next screen, you should see the VirtWiFi network. This is the name of your network to which a virtual Ethernet controller of your Android VMware VM is connected. You can try to use a USB Wi-Fi adapter and connect the adapter directly to the VM as explained in our blog posts about installing Kali Linux on VMware and VirtualBox hypervisors. To do this, insert a USB Wi-Fi adapter to the USB port of a physical computer running a VMware hypervisor (VMware ESXi or VMware Workstation) and use the USB pass-through feature.
 
Configure Date & time, user name, and log in by using a Gmail account, configuring Google services options if needed. After passing all steps of the Android configuration wizard, you will reach the main interface of Android.
 
After that, you can reboot the Android VMware virtual machine and Android should boot successfully without manual manipulations. Disable the sleep mode. You can configure the sleep mode by going to **Setting > Display > Sleep**. You can also enable graphics acceleration (Accelerate 3D graphics) in the VM settings. Notice that there are no VMware Tools compatible with the Android operating system.
 
Deploying an Android VMware virtual machine may be useful for software development and testing. As Android is optimized for devices with a touch screen, using this operating system on a desktop is not a practical option.
