Tucked away with my elementary school report cards and other papers were some yellowed form letters from The College Board declaring my SAT scores. I took the college admissions test twice as a high school student in the late 1980s, prepped only with the practice tests that my school offered.

My SAT scores might have remained a bit of trivia had I not become an education reporter. But my career has given me a reason to think a lot about testing, and what seems to be an intractable test-score gap between black students (as well as Hispanic and American Indian and Alaska Native students) and white and Asian students.
 
Teachers have one of the closest views of student performance, and Education Week recently asked them what they believe are the factors that explain why white students, overall, perform better academically than black students. (The survey respondents were predominantly white, like the teaching population as a whole, with 20 to 30 years in the classroom.) The teachers were given a number of factors to choose from: genetics, discrimination, school quality, student motivation, parenting, income levels, home environments, and neighborhood environments.

A notable minority, about 29 percent, said that genetics are somewhat to extremely significant in explaining academic gaps between black students and white students. (An even higher percentage of respondents, 38 percent, said genetics are a significant reason why Asian students in the aggregate have better academic outcomes than their white peers.)
 
But I have to acknowledge some truth in what these teachers are saying. Yes, it mattered that my parents were middle-class, college-educated folks who filled my childhood home with books. Yes, it mattered that they were able to show me, through their lives, the rewards that can come from a good education. But it also mattered that they were able to work the system well enough to steer me into well-resourced schools in a well-resourced school district.
 
And there are specific policy decisions that amplify the corrosive effects of poverty. Right now, majority-minority school districts get $23 billion less in funding nationally than majority-white school districts, according to EdBuild, a nonprofit organization working to overhaul school finance systems.
 
***Black. White.*** is an American reality television series that aired on FX. The series premiered on March 8, 2006, and supposedly documented two voluntary families of three, one white, and the other black, in which through studio-quality make-up, the two families would give off a facade appearance, of portraying a race that isn't their own, for social experiment purposes. It garnered controversy for its subject matter and perceived reinforcement of racial stereotypes.
 
The show was produced and created by Ice Cube and R. J. Cutler. The series' theme song was "Race Card", performed by Ice Cube and produced by Warren G. The series ran for five weeks ending with a double episode finale.
 
"The show is being sold on the race-switch trick, but tonight's premiere is built around a far more mundane stunt: putting people you know won't get along into close-quarter situations designed to exacerbate the inevitable conflicts. If you think there's any chance that the two men, Brian and Bruno, weren't cast specifically to clash, or that the producers aren't playing up every conflict, you've never seen a reality show."
 
"*Black. White.* is based on two false premises, one more pernicious than the other: that you can understand someone of a different race simply by putting on makeup, and that you need that kind of understanding in order to treat people as the law and morality require."
 
In Canada, *Black. White.* aired on Sun TV, an independent broadcast television station in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. In Australia, the show was seen on Foxtel & Austar channel Fox8. It was also broadcast in Sweden on a public TV channel. A two-part French version of the show was produced and aired on Canal+ in January 2007, named *Dans la peau d'un noir* ("In Black Skin").
 
first check if your images are binary images according to the ImageJ definition (8-bit, only 0 and 255 pixel values). If not, you can use the Image > Process > Make Binary command. Once that is done, you can go to Analyze > Set Measurements and enable the Limit to threshold option (also check that the Area box is checked while you are at it).
 
If you select your image again and do Analyze > Measure, the area column will contain only the number of white pixels since you have enabled the Limit to threshold option (only white pixels are taken into account for a measurement, i.e. from the complete image in your case). You can invert the image (Edit > Invert) and repeat the measurement to get the number of black pixels (that are white after inversion and are thus counted by the measurement).
 
Once i have created my model and rendered it in Sketchup and layed out my various scenes in Layout ready for printing is there a way i can produce black and white versions of my drawings, I have used the monochrome option when printing but this doesnt really produce the desired effect. Is there a plugin for sketchup that changes everything to balck and white ? Any help would be appreciated.
 
I would rather use the Hidden Lines display style. What Monochrome looks like depends on what colours you have assigned to your Default material (front and back faces) in your style. Also, the Hidden Lines style will still respect transparent materials, whereas in Monochrome everything is opaque.
 
Thanks for the answers, however I need to retain the renders i have applied to the surfaces, using these methods removes the renders. I just need to produce a better looking monochrome version of the rendered model.
 
So you want a greyscale version? I would say your best option is to export your LayOut file as PDF, PNG or JPG images and convert it to greyscale in Photoshop (or your favourite image editor). A straight conversion (like printing to a monochrome laser printer) often looks blurry and flat so you will have to apply image adjustments anyway.
 
Micheal,
In Layout first open the SketchUp model window from the window menu. Then select the model image that was imported from SketchUp you would like to be a monochromatic. In the SketchUp window go to the style side, from there you can adjust the model image to different settings. (no additional software needed). Try the straight line styles. I think this will do what you are looking for, but there are lots to mess with.
 
What quality settings are you using (Document setup>Paper)? I always set Edit quality to Low and Output quality to High. If your output is set to Medium or Low, using the highest setting should reduce the blurriness a little.
 
I have also found that when outputting PDF files out of LayOut documents, using any PDF optimizers (like the Reduce File Size function in Adobe Acrobat) has for some reason a much more adverse effect on output from LayOut than from many other applications.
 
thanks for the advice, my output settings are on high and I try not to export as a PDF file unless it is for emailing to a client for approval. I have started altering the colour of the applied renders in sketchup so that when I bring it into layout they look black and white and I can then print without having to select monochrome/greyscale, this tends to give a reasonably good result but is extremely time consuming
 
I have the same issue. Our local building department requires black and white drawings in order for them to scan the drawings into their system. They claim that that my black and white prints of a full colored and rendered pdf result in unreadable drawings with rendered areas being too dark. I also have to create a copy of the sketchup file and adjust each of the materials to a grayscale version in order to get them what they want.
 
Old thread, but I just figured this out today. You can do a rendered bite of you model in SketchUp, but for sending to layout for CD sets, do a color by layer scene. Apply color patterns to each layer (ie: exterior walls) with you custom hatches PNG and then you can maintain the render quality of your model and still have another diagrammatic style for 2d. This is how Skalp works also.
 
here you can see the ugly grey rings arround my print. Does anyone know how to solve this problem? If its not possible to solve it, then multi prints with the AMS and Carbon X1 basically make no sense at all.
 
On the other hand, white and black - in addition to maybe specific filaments - are surely not the nicest players. What you could do is to identify the sweet spot for purging (see for example here: Printables )
 
Other subjects: what is your setting for flush into infill, order of inner wall/outer wall/infill? And lastly, here it even may make sense to have a purge tower again to ensure that any small amount of residue black pigments are cleaned out at the PT.
 
Ah, yes, for support filament the value might be fine, I just saw the white color on the screenshot.
The prime towers main function is to reduce oozing and get a cleaner nozzle after a color change or a longer pause. But since it also purges material from the nozzle by printing, a larger prime tower will help the color bleed problem. But mainly I would increase the flush volumes until the color bleed disappears.
As already said, black to white is by far the hardest to get clean lines as even tiny amounts of residue in the nozzle will be visible on the white.
 
Just how large and persistent are these racial wealth gaps? As figure 1 shows, median net worth for white households has far exceeded that of Black households through recessions and booms over the last thirty years. While movements in white wealth are easier to see due to the larger
