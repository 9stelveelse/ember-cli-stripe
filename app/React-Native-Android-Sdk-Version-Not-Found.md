I would like an option that's more elegant than just creating a mapping, and that does not require republishing every time there is a new android release.Is there a way to do that without an external library?
 
I am facing the same issue, but this is not a problem. If you console.log Platform.Version, it will return the target SDK version. With the help of targetSdkVersion, you can determine the device version (e.g., targetSdkVersion = 33 is for Android 13 and above). Alternatively, you can use the react-native-device-info package; it will provide you with the Device OS version directly.you can checkout this also-

**Additional important information:**The attempt to fix issue with SDK via doctor cannot be successful since it fails with "permission denied" on attempting to install Androd Command Line Tools despite the fact that the PowerShell and IDE are launched with admin privileges.
 
Install **Android SDK Command-line tools**. After doing so, once you call npx react-native doctor you'll no longer see Versions found: N/A (providing that you already have some SDK version(s) installed in your machine, which I assume is the case). After installing it you should see something like:
 
If version found does not match the version react-native supports (version supported) then you need to download the correct SDK version to make them match. When doing so you need to be careful as you have to do two more steps within android studio menus: tools --> sdk manager --> Android SDK. Once here:
 
I got fed up with all the steps that are online that are not working and just clicked on 'e'.It took its time and installed the said missing programs (note that I already installed Android studio and all the SDK instructions on react-native docs before now but for some reason it was not being detected)
 
When building a cross-platform app, you'll want to re-use as much code as possible. Scenarios may arise where it makes sense for the code to be different, for example you may want to implement separate visual components for Android and iOS.

React Native provides a module that detects the platform in which the app is running. You can use the detection logic to implement platform-specific code. Use this option when only small parts of a component are platform-specific.
 
There is also a Platform.select method available that, given an object where keys can be one of 'ios' | 'android' | 'native' | 'default', returns the most fitting value for the platform you are currently running on. That is, if you're running on a phone, ios and android keys will take preference. If those are not specified, native key will be used and then the default key.
 
On iOS, the Version is a result of -[UIDevice systemVersion], which is a string with the current version of the operating system. An example of the system version is "10.3". For example, to detect the major version number on iOS:
 
When your platform-specific code is more complex, you should consider splitting the code out into separate files. React Native will detect when a file has a .ios. or .android. extension and load the relevant platform file when required from other components.
 
You can also use the .native.js extension when a module needs to be shared between NodeJS/Web and React Native but it has no Android/iOS differences. This is especially useful for projects that have common code shared among React Native and ReactJS.
 
I have found a way to resolve my problem. (its very hacky because I have to edit the node\_modules folder and I would prefer the Zoom npm authors to fix it on their side to pin the libraries to the version of react native library)
 
Before troubleshooting an issue, make sure that you have upgraded to **the latest available versions** of the packages. You can install the latest versions by installing the packages again (e.g. npm install package-name).
 
This can happen if you have a custom configuration for metro and haven't specified ts and tsx as valid extensions. These extensions are present in the default configuration. To check if this is the issue, look for a metro.config.js file in your project and check if you have specified the sourceExts option. It should at least have the following configuration:
 
This will tell you if a package you use has a dependency on react-native-safe-area-context. If it's a third-party package, you should open an issue on the relevant repo's issue tracker explaining the problem. Generally for libraries, dependencies containing native code should be defined in peerDependencies instead of dependencies to avoid such issues.
 
If it's already in peerDependencies and not in dependencies, and you use npm, it might be because of incompatible version range defined for the package. The author of the library will need to relax the version range in such cases to allow a wider range of versions to be installed.
 
This can happen if you are passing non-serializable values such as class instances, functions etc. in params. React Navigation warns you in this case because this can break other functionality such state persistence, deep linking etc.
 
If you don't use state persistence or deep link to the screen which accepts functions in params, then the warning doesn't affect you and you can safely ignore it. To ignore the warning, you can use LogBox.ignoreLogs.
 
This can happen when you pass a React component to an option that accepts a function returning a react element. For example, the headerTitle option in native stack navigator expects a function returning a react element:
 
Sometimes you might have noticed that your screens unmount/remount, or your local component state or the navigation state resets when you navigate. This might happen if you are creating React components during render.
 
The component prop expects a React Component, but in the example, it's getting a function returning an React Element. While superficially a component and a function returning a React Element look the exact same, they don't behave the same way when used.
 
Here, every time the component re-renders, a new function will be created and passed to the component prop. React will see a new component and unmount the previous component before rendering the new one. This will cause any local state in the old component to be lost. React Navigation will detect and warn for this specific case but there can be other ways you might be creating components during render which it can't detect.
 
If you're unsure, it's always best to make sure that the components you are using as screens are defined outside of a React component. They could be defined in another file and imported, or defined at the top level scope in the same file:
 
This can result in issues such as button presses taking a long time to register or not working at all, gestures and animations being slow and buggy etc. There can be other functional issues such as promises not resolving, timeouts and intervals not working correctly etc. as well.
 
The issues are not related to React Navigation, but due to the nature of how the Chrome Debugger works. When connected to Chrome Debugger, your whole app runs on Chrome and communicates with the native app via sockets over the network, which can introduce latency and timing related issues.
 
So, unless you are trying to debug something, it's better to test the app without being connected to the Chrome Debugger. If you are using iOS, you can alternatively use Safari to debug your app which debugs the app on the device directly and does not have these issues, though it has other downsides.
 
When I first started to build Android apps with react native, I was soo frustrated with the framework and almost gave up on it. This is because anytime I tried to compile the app with npx react-native run-android I run into a lot of errors. Fixing one error after days of google searching and reading through stack overflow threads, produces a different set of errors which will then take another few days to resolve and the process repeats until you eventually give up or the app miraculously compiles. It was a nightmare.
 
This is a common source of error when building apps with react-native. Sometimes you don't have the time to read the step by step processes involved in installing and setting up the package to work with your application, so you rush through the installation guide and end up missing an important step required to integrate the package with the platform you are working with.
 
React native compiles code to a specific native platform. This means that sometime to make a package to work with a platform for example android, you have to make some changes to native code and build tools.
 
Lets take a popular framework for example react-native-vector-icons, which is a library that allows you to use vector icons from different vector icons toolkits all in one place including FontAwesome, Ionicons, MaterialIcons, AntDesign and so on. You install this package using:

 
There are some packages that require you to install other packages for it to work correctly. take for example, @react-navigation/native library -started/, which requires you to install react-native-screens and react-native-safe-area-context. But on android devices, react-native-screens requires you to configure android/app/src/main/java//MainActivity.java, adding the following to the MainActivity class:

 
Also, if eventually you need to update a package, or maybe you are creating a new react-native app in which you decide to use a newer version of a package, make sure you check for breaking changes, and check if additional steps are required to make the new version work.
 
Basically, what this error is trying to tell you is that this particular package does not support the Gradle version you are using for your android build. Everyone has d
