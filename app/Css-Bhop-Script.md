**We highly recommend using Source Pause Tool for autojump, duckspam and other functionality as it's tick-perfect compared to AutoHotkey.**
Only use these when SPT doesn't work for your game/mod.

This page stores AutoHotkey scripts as well as in-game scripts used for speedrunning on Source Engine. To add a script into your AutoHotkey, find AutoHotkey.ahk in your "Documents" folder after installing AHK. Open the file with notepad or other text editing software, and place the scripts there. After that, you may need to restart AHK or Reload your script.
 
This script is used for bunnyhopping on every game with Source Engine. Basically, it rapidly sends SPACE inputs, which allows you to bunnyhop, while holding space. Using Source Pause Tool is recommended over this as it is tick perfect.
 
*These scripts will mess up your keys and may prevent alt tabbing or even closing the game if you rebind Esc. It will also prevent you from alt tabbing.* 
Adding this line to the top of your script will allow you to enable and disable your script by pressing F7, so you can alt tab and chat:

You can also use this tag above your every script, which will automatically enables the script when the specific Window is active. Some people my find it easier to work with, since you don't have to press a button each time you want to write something in a chat or so. This tag will not stop the script if you enter Steam Overlay In-Game.
 
However, you'll have to duplicate the same script for each Window (game), in order for it to work with the games you want to. If the script has the tag above it, it'll only work when the specified Window is active, and won't work anywhere elseNotes

- These scripts assume you use the default controls ingame. For a customized key config, you will have to change some keys in the AHK script as well.
- Sometimes when using host\_timescale, the scripts may stop working. If that's the case, change the Sleep number from 10 to 40.

An example complete script: 
Hey, I know bhop doesn't give you more speed anymore but it still is useful for airstrike and market gardener, i used to have one but kinda lost it after getting a new pc and I tested the one on tf2 game banana and it crashes the game, my first thought was the wait command (I think it was removed from source?) so i tried taking it out but still crashes.
 
wait command has to be manually allowed on the server, which is not on most (including valve, esea, etf2l and ugc)
bhoping is possible with mouse/keyboard macros but you aint gonna gain much speed in tf2
also it crashes because you've created a nice loop
also i think 1 tick (wait 1) which is minimum for wait command is way too long for a bhop in tf2
 
pretty sure you could do something like this pretty easily with autohotkey instead of the in game wait command which is cheat blocked, but it would be pretty obvious that you're cheating and hitting perfect bhops lol
 
If you want to mess around with this in a pub, go ahead. But even with my very limited experience in anti cheat I can tell within the first 2 seconds if someone is using a bhop script from my own POV, and it's even easier when you spec someone. If any community server admin spots you you're probably getting banned.
You'd obviously never get away with something like this in faceit/tf2center/etc
