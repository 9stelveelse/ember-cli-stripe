This book, which I had sold to my publisher Portfolio/Penguin the year before, was about Roman Stoicism, an ancient practical philosophy that I think lends itself well to the entrepreneurial, creative and business worlds. From that conversation came a remarkable inquiry from Tim:

It took some convincing of my publishers in the US and UK (who owned the rights and were reluctant at first to experiment this way) but eventually the deal happened. And it turns out that this little decision was probably the single biggest direct driver of book sales that I have had in my career.
 
-Tim and I remotely recorded a two-hour podcast supplement that was attached at the back of the book as a bonus. It also turned out to be a great marketing piece as Tim launched his podcast the week before the launch of the book.

-Another fun part of selling on Amazon is affiliate links. I sold 1,122 copies through my own affiliate link for a few thousand dollars in extra royalties, plus commissions on *all the other things those readers bought.*

The reality is that most marketers have the idea that writing a book will be a great social proof for their consulting career and will make them look cool and trustworthy, boosting their perceived authority.
 
Blogs and communities are the places to get the latest tactics. Marketing books are better suited to provide you with high-level strategies. Some still have an expiration date attached to them, and some are evergreen.
 
For example, Lost and Founder, not strictly a marketing book, but written by a great marketer and with some beneficial marketing insights inside, is a book I feel is the best fit for startup co-founders and marketing executives.
 
Yes, products, not marketing campaigns. This book is not strictly about Marketing and more about hooking users in your product, creating stickiness, increasing retention, and converting them into loyal customers.
 
The Before phase covers critical activities you should do before going to market with a new business, defining your target market, crafting your message and story, and researching potential customers with advertising.
 
Customer-centric companies really put the customer at the center of all their efforts, from marketing to product, customer support, and success. The Customers are no longer an anonymous monolith but have become a known entity, and his success is the goal of the business.
 
I thought this book was above average. While not all of it is valuable, there were some very clear insights on how to drive partnership marketing.

I do believe that Marketing ROI should be a priority for SaaS companies, especially during a recession. This book is a great entry point on how to drive outcome based partnership marketing to success.

Glazer and Wool spend considerable time making a case for their point through use-cases, and analysis of companies that have done this successfully.

The central point is simple: In order to achieve a better return on investment and sustainable long-term performance, brands should consider diversifying their marketing strategies by allocating more budget towards scalable and transparent marketing partnerships.
 
Instead of burning out your marketing team by going after endless tactics that might or might not work for your company and industry, they put all the focus of marketing, product, and sales team on customers.
 
This amazing marketing book will teach you how to identify your best customers and how to interview them to understand what got them to buy your product, how they discovered it, how they were doing things before your product, and how using it made their life better.
 
Paul Roetzer, the author is the CEO of the Marketing AI institute and has a great understanding of how AI can be applied to Marketing. I found it a good book, but has not been as impactful for me as other books in this list.
 
On the other hand, I see Marketing teams restructured and hit by layoffs across most SaaS companies, often because of misconceptions about AI and how much it can replace marketers. I also see a lot of confusion across Exec teams on how much AI can really impact marketing.
 
On the other side, many other books are interesting but too long or written in a very boring way but still deserve attention. I often skim through the summary for these books and then decide if they are worth reading fully or not.
 
When I started, I was using the number of books read in a year as my north star metric, going after all those tweets stressing out that successful people used to read hundreds of books per year. Trust me, when it comes to books, quality matters more than quantity.
 
*Adcreep* journeys through the curious and sometimes troubling world of modern advertising. Mark Bartholomew exposes an array of marketing techniques that might seem like the stuff of science fiction: neuromarketing, biometric scans, automated online spies, and facial recognition technology, all enlisted to study and stimulate consumer desire. This marriage of advertising and technology has consequences. Businesses wield rich and portable records of consumer preference, delivering advertising tailored to your own idiosyncratic thought processes. They mask their role by using social media to mobilize others, from celebrities to your own relatives, to convey their messages. Guerrilla marketers turn every space into a potential site for a commercial come-on or clandestine market research. Advertisers now know you on a deeper, more intimate level, dramatically tilting the historical balance of power between advertiser and audience.
 
In this world of ubiquitous commercial appeals, consumers and policymakers are numbed to advertising's growing presence. Drawing on a variety of sources, including psychological experiments, marketing texts, communications theory, and historical examples, Bartholomew reveals the consequences of life in a world of non-stop selling. *Adcreep* mounts a damning critique of the modern American legal system's failure to stem the flow of invasive advertising into our homes, parks, schools, and digital lives.
 
"The ubiquity of advertisements and commercial surveillance are now standard features of our lives. In *Adcreep*, Mark Bartholomew elegantly traces how we got to this point, and explores the disturbing places its likely to take us. Bartholomew has a healthy appreciation of what the law can do to bring us to a different future, but what it won't do without a public that pushes back. If there is going to be a fight, *Adcreep* should be in the pocket of those leading the charge."
