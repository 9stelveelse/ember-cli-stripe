R-STUDIO is a family of powerful, cost-effective disk recovery software. Originally developed by R-Tools Technology, Inc. for experienced data recovery professionals, R-Studio has been redesigned as a scalable, user-friendly all-in-one data recovery tool. By coupling our most advanced file recovery and disk repair technology with an intuitive user-interface, R-Studio provides enterprise and professional-level data recovery specialists the tools they need without hindering the experience of entry-level users.
 
R-Studio Emergency version is run from a USB stick or compact disc when it is necessary to recover data on a computer, on which operating system cannot start up because its system files are corrupted or deleted.

**Check out this special offer for power users and data recovery professionals**: the R-Studio Technician package. In addition to the standard R-Studio features, the R-Studio Technician package offers advanced data recovery features, including forensic mode, data recovery over Internet, R-Studio portable, and unrestricted bootable disk. The R-Studio Technician package also includes licensing for the Windows, Macintosh and Linux versions in one single package.
 
All **R-Studio and R-Studio Emergency features** and capabilities can be evaluated and tested in the Demo mode. The only limitation the Demo mode has pertains to the maximum size of a file that can be recovered. The software running in the Demo mode can be registered on the fly at any time. No reinstallation is required.
 
To see how R-Studio can recover data in a specific case, you may download R-Studio free, install it on your computer, and run it in the Demo mode (for a nonbootable machine, an R-Studio Emergency CD/DVD can be created). If you do not have hard drive recovery experience, we advise you to download and read our Data Recovery Manual before you start. You'll find step-by-step instructions and recommendations prepared by our data recovery specialists. For any additional questions you may always contact our technical support team even if you haven't purchased the software license yet. When lost files are found you may recover files with a size of less that 256KB each. Other files, supported by the pre-viewer built in the software, can be previewed to estimate chances for successful file recovery. If you are satisfied with the result, you may purchase an R-Studio license online right away. Upon receiving a registration key, you may register R-Studio on the fly without even closing the program. As soon as R-Studio is registered, you may continue recovering files.
 
Moreover, using R-Studio in the Demo mode you may create images of your logical disks or entire hard drives. Then you may perform all data recovery actions with those images to keep the source disks safe from accidental data corruption. These images are especially important when you are working with hard drives that start showing signs of dying, to prevent losing data from the drives for good.
 
R-Studio is our most popular full-featured disk recovery solution for local data recovery. Any laptop or desktop computer running R-Studio becomes a powerful data recovery station, capable of solving even the most challenging data recovery and disk repair tasks faced by experienced IT specialists. R-Studio recovers data from any data storage device (Flash drive, hard disk drive, laptop drives, SD cards, etc.) and works with partitions created by every major operating system (Windows, Linux, Mac, Unix). For local disk recovery, R-Studio can read/write, analyze, and image disks and sectors via an IDE/SATA connection or through USB, e-SATA, or FireWire adapters.

In addition to all file recovery features available in R-Studio local versions, R-Studio network products (in versions for both the Windows and Macintosh-based platforms) offer users access to remote computers and data recovery over the network. This feature is very useful when it is necessary to provide system or network administrators with control and efficiency in file recovery over a TCP/IP connection in a network of a couple or thousands of computers with the flexibility and ease of a single machine.
 
It also may be useful when it is necessary to recover data when there is no direct access to a hard drive with the lost files (for example, a corporate network server with an advanced RAID controller).
 
R-Studio Agent and R-Studio Agent Emergency are the service programs that give R-Studio network access to disks on a remote computer. The service program must be installed and/or run on the victim computer, whereas R-Studio is installed and run on another computer, a system administrator workstation, or a workstation dedicated to data recovery. All data transmitted over a network is encrypted with a strong algorithm (3DES) for data security. R-Studio and R-Studio Agent do not pump gigabytes of data over the network to analyze them. R-Studio Agent does the actual data analysis on the computer where it runs and sends only the information on the data to its mother R-Studio.
 
If the OS cannot recognize your RAID, you can create a virtual RAID from its components. Such virtual RAID can be processed like a real one. Standard RAID levels supported: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6. Nested and non-standard RAID level supported: 10(1+0), 1E, 5E, 5EE, 6E. Support for parity delays in all applicable levels. Support for customer-specified RAID layouts.
 
All R-Studio versions create **IMAGE FILES** for an entire **Hard Disk, Partition or its part**. Such image files can be compressed and split into several files to put it on CD/DVD/flash or FAT16/FAT32/exFAT. Then the image files can be processed like regular disks.
 
The advanced **multi-pass disk imaging algorithm** with variable parameters and **runtime imaging** added to R-Studio Technician make it the ideal complete solution for creating a professional data recovery workstation.
 
R-Studio comes jam-packed with many useful features. So many, in fact, that a basic user may struggle to understand what most of them do. However, having a wide selection of features to use opens up a lot of functionality from a single application.
 
The main interface of R-Studio is easily overwhelming the first time you see it. It favors showing the user as much technical information as possible, and as a result, it appears overcomplicated and challenging to navigate. For recovery experts, having this information readily available can make your life easier. For the average person who wants to recover a few documents, a lot of it is unnecessary.
 
The pricing structure for R-Studio is unconventional and comprehensive, to the point where buying a license can be confusing. You first need to decide what operating system you want to buy a license for, then what sort of file systems you want to recover data from.
 
On first impression, it seems R-Studio could simplify their pricing by removing the **R-Studio NTFS** and **R-Studio FAT** versions and just keep the standard R-Studio license. Most data recovery tools already support both NTFS and FAT file systems in their base versions, and by making this change, making a choice will be easier.

I recommend to using the BLR data recovery tool for your data loss since I just had data loss due to a problem with an external drive in my Windows 10 and will attempt this data recovery software to restore data.
 
Top options for professional use are R-Studio(Windows, Mac, Linux), Disk Drill(Windows, Mac), Stellar Data Recovery Professional, DMDE(Windows, Mac, Linux). For the best chance of recovering your data, act quickly and avoid further use of the storage device.
 
Ultimately, the best data recovery software for you will depend on the specific nature of your data loss scenario, your familiarity with the software, and the level of support and features required for professional use.
