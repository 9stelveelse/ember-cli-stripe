Sachin wow what a movie, An unexpected gem. Had no expectations whatsoever, as the trailer felt like a espn documentary of sorts, but what they had in store was unlike of any sports movie made ever. Not just the story of Sachin, but of Indian cricket. If you have even a pint of interest in cricket, do yourself a favor and watch this movie now. Especially 80"s kids, relive your childhood again by watching this, million no no billion thanks to the person who came up with this idea of making, Hats off, SACHINNNNNNNNN SACHINNNNNNNNNNNN.........

Sachin is just not another sportsman to Indians and cricket fans all over the world, he is an emotion that has been part of them for more than 2 decades. Probably the most commercially successful documentary in India exploiting the emotion, the God of cricket. Although the documentary is rarely anything but the compilation of the highlights of Sachin's greatest moments in Cricket, that is basically the greatest moments of Indian Cricket.
