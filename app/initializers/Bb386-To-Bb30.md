This tool is fantastic, it makes light work of BB30 bearing removal and installation. The ability to remove is a league above everybody else. There is no hammering and you do not have to brace the bike. Very helpful guy.
 
Removal and replacement of Bearing is a doddle with this. I wish I had one sooner. Bearings replaced in about 5 minutes with no hammering. Very well designed and good value. Use of standard components is a bonus.

My first thought of this was plastic cups. This guy is a clown but he seems to know what he is doing and i would have zero hesitations in buying another item from him. Removal tool works a treat on my cannondale frame. The plates will work with the wiggle press but they rattle
 
Bought from eBay but i thought i would leave some feedback here. The removal tool makes life very easy. Well designed and no hammering. My only criticism is it can be awkward shuffling multiple spanners around but given the price versus the rest it really is great value. Service from hambini was prompt courteous.
 
Bought these together with the excellent NTN BB30 bearings. I was contemplating ditching them and going for a Hambini Shimano BB but after a bit of dialogue, Hambini advised to go for this option as he thought I had a fit issue. His guidance was spot on. Used this kit to remove and install the new bearings. A dab of loctite and activator and all of my creaking has gone. What a waste of time I spent endless weekends with the saturday boys in halfrauds.
 
So simple but so effective, this makes taking bearings out and replacing them so easy. I was paying œ15 labour each time my BB bearings needed replacing. I now replace them more often and buy better bearings.
 
My local bike shop recommended park tools hammer style bearing remover and press which cost more than double this one. I opted for this after watching the YouTube video and i have not been disappointed. It works exactly like it does in the video and bb service is a non event. Very surprised nobody uses this style of remover. Press works without issues as well.

I own a bike shop so this tool gets used frequently, 3-4 times a day. I swapped out the nuts for two of the M12 presses and this has completely transformed the time taken to swap bearings out. I moved to this tool after a few issues with the park tools and cracking bike frames. Great product and vast technical knowledge in bearings when you need it. A+
 
Bottom line up front: A well thought out tool that gets the job done with no drama. A very well though out tool that makes removal and installation of pressfit bottom bracket bearings child play (bb30A in my case). One caveat that I learned while installing the 6806 bearings. I had used loctite 609 with 7471 activator on the bearing and bottom bracket mating area before installation. This caused difficulty pressing the bearing in as it bound and went in crookedly. I found that using a bead of loctite on the bearing after just setting it in place made the installation even and easier.
 
I have a Cannondale Supersix evo which is labelled as having a Pressfit BB30. What it actually has is a PF30 with internal lips on the cups so needed modifications to this tool in order to remove. Outstanding assistance was provided from Hambini throughout.
 
About 30cm will do, the limiting factor is how much space the press handles or the nuts take up at either end. A bottom Bracket is approx 9cm, the frame width is probably about the same, and then the adaptors on top of that.
 
When the BB386EVO standard was introduced with the BH Ultralight, we could almost hear the collective sigh around another standard. But on paper, it offers a lot of flexibility in its implementation and does allow frame manufacturers some impressive additional real estate at the bottom bracket shell.
 
Shown here are two FSA SL-K Light compact 110 BCD cranksets with 175mm arms. The one with black rings and silver spindle is a BB30 crankset (with 36/46 cyclocross rings). The other is BB386EVO with 34/50 compact rings. FSA gave the EVO spindle a gold hue simply for visual differentiation, making it quick and easy to identify which is which.
 
BB30 and Pressfit BB30 are based on a 68mm wide bottom bracket shell. BB386EVO has an 18.5mm longer spindle designed around an 86.5mm wide BB shell. The full spindle length obviously includes the space for the non-drive crank arm to mount and a wave spring that maintains proper bearing load.
 
For the Pressfit bottom brackets, the ones shown above are the same for either standard PFBB30 frames or EVO frames. The gray plastic shell between bearing cups slides open enough to accommodate the wider EVO frames, too.
 
Jzilla, I totally agree with you. The bolt that held everything together on my SLK light crank which came on my CAAD 10 kept coming loose. FSA would blame cannondale and me. Too bad all three of the guys on my team who bought one had the exact same problem. It would loosen up in less than 100 miles, so on a 130 mile road race, I had a horrible squeak ever pedal stroke.
 
My Fuji comes with a Rotor 3d + f crankset with a pf86 bb. the bearings seem to be extra wide and less deep than typical. The crank has a 30mm spindle but the bb shell is standard pf 86. does 386 evo have a larger diameter bb OD ?
 
Hi, I was given a gossamer 386 crankset to be an upgrade on my fsa omega fitted to my standard non bb30 Boardman winter bike. I have the fsa spacers to fill the gaps between cups and cranks. Is that all I need?
