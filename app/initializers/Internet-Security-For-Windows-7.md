Hi, I would like to ask if anyone else has this problem, because after installing EIS, Windows Defender is not disabled even though it is shown as disabled in the settings, even after a reboot. 
When Eset analyzes some downloaded file or sometimes when I browse web pages both antivirus use a lot of the processor.
Sometimes I notice performance drops, 
Please I would be very grateful for any help you can give me.

It's Windows itself that disables Defender when another 3rd party AV registers in the Security Center. You can open a support ticket for further troubleshooting, however, it's unlikely that we'll be able to help. What you could try is rebuilding the WMI repository as per -the-performance-team/wmi-rebuilding-the-wmi-repository/ba-p/373846.
 
In Windows Security Center -> Threat & Protection setting, verify that you have not enabled Periodic scanning per below screen shot. If Period scanning is enabled, the Windows Defender engine will load at system startup and remaining running regardless of if a scan is being performed.
 
Smart App Control's primary protection method is its cloud scanning component. Smart App Control like Microsoft Defender uses file "Mark of the Web" (MotW) status criteria for cloud scanning: . There currently exists a vulnerability in MotW: -attacks-use-windows-security-bypass-zero-day-to-drop-malware/ , yet to be patched by Microsoft, that is currently being actively exploited by hackers. In reality and withstanding any vulnerability status, it is rather trivial to strip MotW ADS from a file download.

Since Windows 11 22H2, the Defender service is always on with all AV products. It's the norm now. But it won't cause any CPU or Disk usage, it stays idle but will update signatures at least once a day/after every system start or restart if fast startup is off.
 
Thank you all very much for your answers, so it is because of Windows 11 and its new update. In my case along with the performance errors with Nvidia GPUs, I think I will have to go back to Windows 10.
 
Yeah, it uses some ram which will vary from system to system, but there's no CPU usage or any disk activity. Any usual methods like GPO doesn't work to disable the service. Other methods described by turning off tamper protection, taking ownership, changing permission, etc. should work.
 
Microsoft describes the Sandbox as "Running Windows Defender Antivirus in a sandbox ensures that in the unlikely event of a compromise, malicious actions are limited to the isolated environment, protecting the rest of the system from harm. The goal for the sandboxed components was to ensure that they encompassed the highest risk functionality like scanning untrusted input, expanding containers, and so on. At the same time, we had to minimize the number of interactions between the two layers to avoid a substantial performance cost."

Sandbox is disabled by default and only available for builds 1709 and newer.
 
It came enabled by default when Windows 11 came out without third-party AV installed. But a few months later they pushed an update somewhere along the way, either part of a Defender update or Windows update, which disabled the sandbox. It even got disabled in Windows Insider editions. Later it was enabled in Windows 11 insider editions once again. So performance impact or some bugs made MS disable it. I for example found a bug when MD won't delete threats when sandbox is enabled. It only blocked, but didn't delete.
 
It appears to me that the reason MS is running Defender in Win 11 is to support SmartApp cloud scanning. I wonder if SmartApp was permanently disabled, Defender would revert to Win 10 behavior and not load at system startup time? This would be preferable to permanently disabling MD. I assume with MD permanently disabled, it will not auto startup if there's an issue with an installed third party AV real-time protection.

Have you ever tried to run a program only to find your security software is blocking it - then can't figure out what you need to do to get it running? Is it the firewall, the behavior blocker, the sandbox, or the antivirus which is stopping it? Comodo's new unblock applications feature allows you to release applications with a single click from whichever security component has blocked them.
 
The Center for Internet Security is a nonprofit entity whose mission is to 'identify, develop, validate, promote, and sustain best practice solutions for cyberdefense.' It draws on the expertise of cybersecurity and IT professionals from government, business, and academia from around the world. To develop standards and best practices, including CIS benchmarks, controls, and hardened images, they follow a consensus decision-making model.
 
CIS benchmarks are configuration baselines and best practices for securely configuring a system. Each of the guidance recommendations references one or more CIS controls that were developed to help organizations improve their cyberdefense capabilities. CIS controls map to many established standards and regulatory frameworks, including the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and NIST SP 800-53, the ISO 27000 series of standards, PCI DSS, HIPAA, and others.
 
Each benchmark undergoes two phases of consensus review. The first occurs during initial development when experts convene to discuss, create, and test working drafts until they reach consensus on the benchmark. During the second phase, after the benchmark has been published, the consensus team reviews the feedback from the internet community for incorporation into the benchmark.
 
CIS Hardened Images are securely configured virtual machine images based on CIS Benchmarks hardened to either a Level 1 or Level 2 CIS benchmark profile. Hardening is a process that helps protect against unauthorized access, denial of service, and other cyberthreats by limiting potential weaknesses that make systems vulnerable to cyberattacks.
