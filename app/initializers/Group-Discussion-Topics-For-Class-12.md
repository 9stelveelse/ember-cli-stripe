To restore deleted threads and posts, you must have the **See Deleted Posts** permission and **Display deleted posts** option on the **Settings** page enabled. If the post you restore is a reply to another post, and the other post was also deleted, both posts are restored.
 
Are you searching for new ways to keep your students on their toes? Sometimes it can feel overwhelming always looking for new, fun, and upbeat ways to keep your students engaged and entertained in your group discussions.
 
Social elements like incorporating interesting topics to discuss in a group *complement* online courses because they enable social learning, peer-to-peer support, and student-to-instructor support. They also enable students to hold each other accountable for learning goals while creating a sense of community and belonging.

Adding different topics for group discussion in online learning communities is another great and effective way for students to collaborate and connect with one another. A learning community is a shared place for discussion, so why not spice up your interactions by throwing in some thought-provoking and interesting topics to discuss in a group?
 
We find purpose and accountability in learning communities, regardless if they are from online or in-person group discussions. The style of traditionally learning in a classroom is currently being sidelined as the online classroom learning style has gained popularity in recent years. However, there are some upsides and downsides to each option, which we will cover.
 
Whatever the context, it is helpful to structure the discussions in a way that defines boundaries for the process and provides some degree of closure within the classroom. Be sure the topics you choose are relevant to your community and that they will promote critical thinking and analysis among your members. With some thoughtful planning, you can use group discussion to build a strong online community.
 
Have an idea of how you want to wrap up the discussion, especially if there are time constraints. It may be a good idea to summarize the solid points that were brought up throughout the discussion, and praise everyone for participating. This will help to keep the momentum going for the next group discussion, ensuring that your learning community continues to connect with each other.
 
One of the most important aspects of a successful group discussion is making sure that everyone has a chance to share their thoughts and opinions. If certain parties are dominating the discussion, actively call on others as you moderate the discussion to give them the floor. You could even go alphabetically. This is especially useful to help engage students who are more shy and would rather not say anything at all.
 
Let your students know how they did in the group discussion. Offering individual constructive feedback can help your students feel more included and motivated to participate even more during the next group discussion.
 
Discussion forums are essential to learning communities because they give students a place to keep the conversation going and generate more ideas on the topic. Discussion forums also help foster connection and engagement between your students.
 
Online communities can be a great way to bring your students together in one place where they can discuss course content, apply their learnings, and ask questions. This also helps you get a pulse check on what your audience wants to learn from you.
 
This semester I started group discussions. I didn't want there to be a 40 or 50-post thread that was impossible for students to read through, and decided instead to have students (28 per class) assigned to three or four groups to make the discussion more manageable.
 
When I editing the discussion forum and selected "group assignment," when I created the groups I just selected the option for students to be automatically assigned to a group for that assignment, and then selected "4" for the number of groups. According to Canvas, that should have solved the issue.
 
However, when I go to grade the discussion forum in Speed Grader, none of the posts are visible. It says "below are the discussion posts for Student X, or you can view the full discussion." But there are no posts below. It's a blank page.
 
To see anything, I have to click on "view the full discussion," and then search that student's name in the forum to find their posts.

How do I make it so I can see the students' discussion posts in Speed Grader, like I used to be able to do before using groups? 

I researched here a bit already, but the only answer I saw said to change some settings in the Gradebook, but I don't have any options for that in my Gradebook. Thanks so much!
 
In this guide, How do I assign a graded discussion to a course group? It states, "**Note:** Please ensure all students have been added to a group before assigning a group set to the group discussion. If a student is not added to a group and replies to the discussion, the student's reply will be part of the original discussion topic. Replies on the original discussion topic can be viewed by clicking the **View the full discussion** link in SpeedGrader."
 
I suspect your groups did not populate with students as you expected.You can view who the members of the groups are to try to identify missing students. See, How do I view all groups in a course as an instructor?
 
And, did you know that you can do this using one single discussion? You can then make that a Group Discussion, and assign it to a Group Set. Then the members of a group within that group set are only seeing the discussion replies from the members of their respective groups.
 
To start planning a discussion (or any instruction, for that matter) decide what you want your students to get out of the discussion. For example, do you want them to share responses, make new connections, and articulate the implications of a text? Should they be able to work certain problems by the end of the hour? Should they be able to interpret and critique a journalistic photograph or a piece of art? Deciding on and articulating the objective for the discussion will help you decide what kinds of discussion activities will best help your students reach that objective. Remember that you can organize a discussion in many different ways: you can have students work in small groups, role-play, choose sides for a debate, or write and share a paragraph in response to the theme in question1. You will also want to leave time to wrap up and summarize the discussion for your students (or have students summarize it), or to debrief after activities such as debates or role-plays.
 
Many discussion activities can be used in the classroom. Choose one that will help your students meet your goals for the discussion. The more specific you can be in assigning the task, the more likely your students will be to succeed at it. Consider the protocols for tasks such as Think-Pair-Share, Affinity Mapping, Chalk Talk and other conversation structures.
 
Many techniques can get students to share what their smaller groups have done with the entire class: verbally, on newsprint/flipchart, blackboard or overhead, ditto/photocopy, etc. And you don't have to hear from everyone; calling on a few groups at random to report works quite well. To encourage student cross-team competition in Team-Based Learning, reporting out from groups is simultaneous. Answers can be posted to a Powerpoint slide or pieces of newsprint hung on walls of class.
 
I have an instructor that splits her class into groups and has them discuss among themselves. She wants to know if there is a way that, after the discussion has taken place, she can open the group discussions up where everyone in the class can see each group's board and responses. I initially thought we could accomplish this by unchecking "This is a Group Discussion" in edit mode, but once there are replies you cannot do that.
 
As for a way to do this... right off the top of my head I can't think of a good way other than having individual discussions for each group, use differentiate tool, and then after it's over open them up to everyone in the class to view and/or comment.
 
Could you simply print the discussion to a PDF format and share it with the whole class? This could work if your discussions are text-based, versus video discussion posts. Would that meet your instructor's needs?
 
This question is as answered as it's going to get, I think. I suggested @tbunag 's PDF idea to the instructor, but she wasn't super thrilled with this option. I have not heard back from her so I'm not sure if she went forward with this or redesigned her activity.
 
While this conversation took place over a year ago, I am interested if any other solutions have been devised? I would like to do exactly the same thing in my on-line classes as what Jennifer suggests. This works GREAT in the classroom, but there doesn't seem to be an easy way to do it in Canvas, unfortunately.
 
Unfortunately we have not come up with a more effective solution than already suggested. This hasn't been something I've been asked about very often, so I haven't heard from faculty if they have come up with a useful way to accomplish this.
