This will feature the finale of the group's 20th-anniversary tour '**ARASHI Anniversary Tour 520**' which was held at Tokyo Dome in December of 2019. It was directed by **Tsutsumi Yukihiko** and over one hundred cameras were used to capture the concert footage. This is the first time that a live film has been created for a Johnny's artist.
 
Nippon Television Network Corporation (NTV) has announced a joint campaign with its local network affiliates to commence from March 20th, Sunday, to encourage those affected by the recent Tohoku Earthquake as well as to cheer up the entire nation of Japan.

Celebrities and announcers who appear on NTV's programs will send a "shout-out" in the form of a three-second spot CM. We will broadcast these live messages of encouragement such as"Let's Not Give Up, Japan!"and "Stand up, Japan!"by television personalities such as ARASHI, Shinsuke Shimada and Cream Stew.
 
The video images will be shown in brightly-colored building blocks to symbolize the rebuilding of Japan, one block at a time.
This campaign, taking place through the television screen, is a shout-out by the television and entertainment industries to all of our viewers.
NTV and its local network affiliates will continue to convey helpful information to those victims of the recent earthquake and to deliver uplifting programs.
