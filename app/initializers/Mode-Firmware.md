This occurs when the Boot0 pin is floating or when it is grounded. I can also force entry into this mode by sending the AT+BOOT command while the module is still being responsive.
 
From here I have to flash a new version of the firmware from the file RAK3172-E\_latest\_final.hex using the programmer connected over UART. Once I do this the module returns to a usable state for a small amount of time, but then eventually returns to .

Thank you for your prompt reply. We are developers for a big customer that has already ordered a large amount of RAK3172 units, we are moving to this unit from the 4270 due to its LoRaWAN certification status.
 
Question 1: Is the update to RUI3 required for the module to be LoRaWAN certified (and pass the certification test)
Question 2: Once in BOOT mode it only comes out of it if we actually flash new code, is there an alternative?
 
The issue is caused by the bounce on the reset pin. Is there a way to remove it? Right now, RUI3 bootloader was designed to be like that so that user has the ability to recover a firmware via double-click on reset.
 
So, it seems to me that there is something going wrong when flashing with ST-LINK. Why does it work with v1.0.4 but not with v3.2.0 or v3.4.2? I tried to follow the documentation here (STM32CubeProgrammer Guide for RAK Modules | RAKwireless Documentation Center) as close as possible. But it did not work. What is the problem?
 
On the latest RUI3 firmware, we have an implementation of enabling boot mode by double clicking (pulling to GND) the reset pin. This causes the Boot Mode. To leave boot mode state, you have to execute at+run command.
 
Yesterday I received the Zwift Hub One. I updated the Zwift Hub without any problems. After that I connected the Zwift Click to the Companion App and tried to update the firmware. But it stays on Set DFU mode and the connection of Zwift Click is lost after a few minutes. But the blue LED stops flashing and I am obviously connected to the app, otherwise I would not be able to start the update.

I had the same issue with my Zwift play controllers last week. Eventually I had to just switch them off. Fortunately, they still worked fine during following rides. That happened several times, so I stopped trying to upgrade for the week. This weekend they upgraded just fine.
 
Hello everyone. This is Juan, a Zwift colleague. I have been reading each posts carefully and gathered information from you about being stuck in device firmware update mode. According to our reports, there are not many users affected by this. However, we care about your Zwift experience. I noticed that this unexpected behavior is commonly related to Android devices. The best alternative here would be to use Zwift Companion on a different smartphone or tablet to update the firmware. If the issue persists, I encourage you to contact us at zwift.com/contact-us to go deeper into each case.
 
Hi all, New to the Zwift world and had exactly the same issues as reported on this thread. This is an **Android** problem, installing the companion app on my iPhone the Click firmware update completes instantly. My issue is now click connects, but drops whilst on rides. My gears disappear after a few seconds of riding. I have only had Zwift for less than 48hrs, customer experience is not great! The drive train nut saga, and now Click. I might just buy warmer clothes and just ride outside
 
As zheren159 said, that firmware update on the site is 2 years old and all newly purchased keyboards already have it by default from the factory. You can safely skip upgrading it yourself, rather there are peoples who had issues after updating it when it was not required.
 
Is Corsair planning on updating the firmware update software for Windows 10? Sometimes my keyboard gets messed up, and I have to "flash" the firmware, as re-installing it often solves problems I have with the keyboard.
 
Congrats on getting out of EM Mode, I just got the TS-R8.0XL/R5 and it went into EM Mode after selecting a Port Trunk. I spent several hours with Tech Support, and they had me add the Debug option in the .ini file, but it still didn't work, I ended up taking the NAS Home and put a simple linksys switch in between the Station and my laptop and set my laptop with the following.
 
I realized the station had to be put into DHCP Mode(did that through the Navigator, by right clicking and selecting configure) and selected DHCP and renew IP Address. �Restarted up in EM Mode which took a little while to get into it. Then I ran the TSUpdate with the Debug mode option and chose force update on it, �You have to right click the title bar on the TSupdate window.
 
Thanks �s4mb4 . Your tips worked (noformating=0). Currently it is formating. I must say Buffalo needs to improve the open box exprience. This is the worst new gear purchase experience I ever had. Caused me to return my new unit and get another one with the same issue (EM mode). I don't think average customer will go through this. They will go for other vendors. :smileymad:
 
Is there any way to get the radio out of bootloader mode via shorting pins or something? I know there is a way to get it into bootloader mode. I imagine the radio is half baked right now due to the failure of qgroundcontrol to load the firmware completely.
 
First I would like to do it they way you are discribing, I think the reason they will not do it that way is they do not want people to get ahold of there firmware (This is just speculation). It is annoying to yave to keep shutting off lan and then connecting the printer back to my account for updates.
 
Another frustration I have is when not in LAN Only mode, the slicer will only see the printer via cloud and send the gcode via cloud also. Sometimes this will take forever or freeze up during load. Never have those issues in LAN only mode.
 
My upgrade for EX2 went smoothly yesterday night though and did not take more than 10-15 minutes (my earlier mention of multiple firmware updates were for Sunday when upgrading to a previous firmware version - but not using automatic method but manual - I prefer manual ALWAYS and have auto-update turned off).
 
In the end, I did a reset (holding the hidden button in for 5-10 seconds). It restarted and just wiped whatever user settings it previously had. I was able to find the DHCP assigned IP address in my router and although I can still access the web interface using this new IP address, the result is exactly the same and I am just stuck on the Safe Mode message.
 
I then grabbed my tablet (Xperia Z Tablet) and tried using Chrome Beta from there. A few seconds after the file had finished uploading (takes a minute over WiFi), I then got the numbers counting up in the centre of the circle and the power LED on the MyCloud starting flashing yellow.
 
There also seems to be a, probably unrelated, problem with the Safe Mode web interface uploading the .bin file to the MyCloud and then initiating the upgrade process. This seems to only work on certain browsers/platforms and is clearly not very robust.
 
I have this exact issue, do you remember how to fix this?
From your comment I undersand that you turned the drone on **with out the GPS connected**, then connected the drone to Mission Planner, then waited 5 minutes and connected the GPS phiscally and it finally showed up in the UAVCAN screen?
 
Hi all, I ran into the same problem yesterday, when trying to upgrade the firmware on my Here3 using Mission Planner 1.3.79 and Arduplane V4.3.1 My HW is a cube orange on a mini carrier board, the GPS is connected using CAN2 as that is the only port available on the mini carrier. I was upgrading Here3 from 1.5.33544151 to 1.8 AB157ABD.
 
I believe the problem comes from using the CAN2 port during the upgrade. The Here3 went into maintenance mode and health was reported as critical in Mission Planner. It also was reporting SW Version 0.0 when it was in maintenance mode.
 
This would be something to ask of the Mission Planner developer, but my guess is that the code to update the CAN GPS expects it to be connected to CAN1, and may not have even been tested with a carrier mini where only CAN2 is available. This was my assumption and why I tested another setup where CAN1 is available and was able to complete the upgrade without issues.
 
Would like to hear more about the issue with wired devices. These devices are not connected to the Orbi products (router and satellites)? But are instead connected to a router that the Orbi is also connected to? And, it is not convenient to move them to the Orbi system?
 
Netgear has set up a community forum specifically for the Orbi AX (WiFi 6) products. Most of the people who watch that forum are more likely to have experience with Orbi AX and know how to work it better than those of us who follow this "general Orbi" forum. Might be more likely to find someone who has a solution if the question is posted there:
 -AX/bd-p/en-home-orbi-ax
 
I have dozens of wired network devices, I need network discovery across those network devices from a WIRELESSLY connected device (ala iPhone) for them to function. Hence moving them to the orbi routing is NOT preferrable. Moreover I have several different IOS apps that access the different wired devices, static routing is not possible for some apps and even if it were would be a nightmare to administer.
