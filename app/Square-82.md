A square is a special case of a rhombus (equal sides, opposite equal angles), a kite (two pairs of adjacent equal sides), a trapezoid (one pair of opposite sides parallel), a parallelogram (all opposite sides parallel), a quadrilateral or tetragon (four-sided polygon), and a rectangle (opposite sides equal, right-angles), and therefore has all the properties of all these shapes, namely:[5]

Because it is a regular polygon, a square is the quadrilateral of least perimeter enclosing a given area. Dually, a square is the quadrilateral containing the largest area within a given perimeter.[6] Indeed, if *A* and *P* are the area and perimeter enclosed by a quadrilateral, then the following isoperimetric inequality holds:
 
Every acute triangle has three inscribed squares (squares in its interior such that all four of a square's vertices lie on a side of the triangle, so two of them lie on the same side and hence one side of the square coincides with part of a side of the triangle). In a right triangle two of the squares coincide and have a vertex at the triangle's right angle, so a right triangle has only two *distinct* inscribed squares. An obtuse triangle has only one inscribed square, with a side coinciding with part of the triangle's longest side.

In spherical geometry, a square is a polygon whose edges are great circle arcs of equal distance, which meet at equal angles. Unlike the square of plane geometry, the angles of such a square are larger than a right angle. Larger spherical squares have larger angles.
 
A **crossed square** is a faceting of the square, a self-intersecting polygon created by removing two opposite edges of a square and reconnecting by its two diagonals. It has half the symmetry of the square, Dih2, order 4. It has the same vertex arrangement as the square, and is vertex-transitive. It appears as two 45-45-90 triangles with a common vertex, but the geometric intersection is not considered a vertex.
 
The K4 complete graph is often drawn as a square with all 6 possible edges connected, hence appearing as a square with both diagonals drawn. This graph also represents an orthographic projection of the 4 vertices and 6 edges of the regular 3-simplex (tetrahedron).
 
Since 1792, Moore Square has been a place of gathering, reflection, entertainment, and recreation for the citizens of Raleigh. The four-acre downtown urban green space was originally conceived as one of five public green spaces for the City of Raleigh.
 
The square is bordered by East Martin Street to the south, South Person Street to the east, East Hargett Street to the north, and South Blount Street to the west. The Square is open to the public daily from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. with extended hours during special events.
 
The Moore Square Visitor Center features a history exhibit detailing the historic significance of the Square and surrounding district to the city of Raleigh and a gift shop featuring local Raleigh goods and unique Moore Square souvenirs. Stop in to learn Moore!
 
Welcome to our libation haven, where craftsmanship meets creativity in every sip. Our drinks section showcases the heart and soul of our brewery and distillery, where passion for flavor and dedication to quality converge.
 
The food was so delicious! The salad was everything and my friend said the shrimp and grits was so good! The server was amazing and the ambiance is beautiful! Go ahead and give them a try. The food and service is superb!
 
It was a nice cool refreshing day and we wanted a place with good food and outside dining. We picked Square One as we had been there in the past and it is reliable and consistent in its food. We were pleased and tried items we had not had before such as the Scotch Egg and the Philly sandwich. We were happy with everything and enjoyed a nice evening out.
 
Love Square One! The restaurant always feels warm and welcoming, especially on a snowy Saint Louis night. We had the fish and chips, and it was perfect. The fish was tender and flaky on the inside with the perfect amount of crunch on the outside. The handcut fries were light and crispy. Service was awesome throughout the restaurant, and the beer & cocktails were the icing on the cake!
 
Great spot for happy hour or a dinner and some beer. They do have one of the best props in town if you can get in on a nice day. Located in the charming lafayette square near other fantastic restaurants and fun places to hang out. I hear they have a mean brunch too but have never been lucky enough to try it!
 
Food was way more delicious than I expected, service was great. Will definitely be back again. I ordered the fish and chips and the batter was amazingly crunchy and light, the fish was tender and flaky. So so good

With a bevy of high-rise residences filled with top-end luxury apartments and some of the best fine dining experiences in the city, residents can marvel at their options, while also enjoying the luxury retail shopping in the area, all of which surrounds the handsome tree-filled park.
 
Named for astronomer and clockmaker David Rittenhouse, the family-friendly park remains one of the most lovely and peaceful spots in which to paint, read, relax on a park bench or catch-up with friends.
 
Classical urns, many bearing relief figures of ancient Greeks, rest on pedestals at the entrances and elsewhere throughout the square. Ornamental lamp posts contribute to an air of old-fashioned gentility.
 
In a similar plaza in the northeast walkway stands the Evelyn Taylor Price Memorial Sundial, a sculpture of two cheerful, naked children who hold aloft a sundial in the form of a giant sunflower head.
 
Created by Philadelphia artist Beatrice Fenton, the sundial memorializes a woman who served as the president of the Rittenhouse Square Improvement Association and Rittenhouse Square Flower Association.
 
Typically held in beginning of May, the blockbuster Rittenhouse Square Spring Festival attracts tens of thousands for a celebration of the season complete with food, shopping, and a showcase of live entertainment.
 
During the holidays, hundreds of celebrants pack the park for the official start of the season during the Rittenhouse Square Christmas Tree Lighting, featuring more than 5,000 brilliant holiday lights.
 
It's bee balm time again. I have grown *Monarda fistulosa* in pots but find that it is happier, in-ground. With a breeze and some grasses for company. In a tony patch of soil in front of our building a hot pink-flowered cultivar is very happy alongside agastache and fennel. (And yes, that entire four-ish square feet is vibrating with pollinators.
 
This is the first flush of roses since the shrubs were parched during a 10-day absence. We left the day after every single one was in full bloom, and came back to crisped leaves. A month later, they have recovered well, and are handling our week's heat indexes of 100 degrees Fahrenheit better than I am.
 
It has been a picnic-y summer, so far. This one was at Rockefeller State Park Preserve, after a walk I led, hosted by the New York State Department of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. Our focus was on invasive edible plants, in the ongoing and evolving conversation about how to control them. There is no simple answer.
 
Two focaccias (*focaccie*), featuring apricots and mugwort, a pea and fava bean spread with field garlic, cream cheese drizzled with lilac-infused honey that I made in Maine, tartlets filled with serviceberries, and a very delicious strawberry cordial - my favorite thing this season. It can be made with any soft fruit and a herb; so far, I have used ground ivy (recipe here on Gardenista), mugwort, and bergamot/bee balm.
 
On a hill at Green-Wood Cemetery is a monument dedicated to the 148,000 New York soldiers enlisted in the Revolutionary War. Often, when I walk here, I imagine what the ground under my feet looked like, and what the sounds may have been, then, because this is where battles were fought.
 
But what drew me to the monument this day was the cloud of giant fleeceflowers in bloom at its base. They are closely related to highly invasive Japanese knotweed, but apparently behave much better. *Persicaria polymorpha:* statuesque, yet floofy. In peak bloom, now.
 
First up, Forest Toddies. On the cold-weather walks I lead, I sometimes make a hot toddy to warm frigid fingers. (It stays steaming in Thermos flasks.) It's alcohol-free but manages to taste grown up and complex. Everyone asks how it is made. My current hot toddy recipe is based on fresh apple cider, with the addition of citrus and herbs, a whisper of fir, and sometimes even a beneficial mushroom.
 
When I've made the toddy and allowed all the flavors to infuse, it is strained and bottled, to live in the fridge. For the last month the Frenchman and I have been sipping a version of it (it welcomes improvisation) every evening, to see what life is like without a 6pm cocktail (no surprise, life goes on, without a hitch, but it's a useful experiment). But you can also drink it cold, shaken up with the hooch of your choice. I recommend bourbon. Good for parties.
 
It's yuzu season, and the aromatic, golden citrus are a highlight of my growing and eating year. Our own little tree had it's first proper crop this year (last year it produced three, I think), and it still has some plump fruit ripening on its branches.
 
You can buy high-quality yuzu fruit online (they make a special gift) in the US from *Flavors by Bhumi,* New Jersey-based growers who also source unusual citrus fruit from other grow
