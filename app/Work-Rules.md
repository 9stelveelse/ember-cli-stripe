**Major Rule Violations**
Major offenses include any willful, deliberate violation of Institute or safety rules of such a degree that continued employment of the individual may not be desirable. The following are examples of some offenses that may subject an employee to immediate discharge without warning:
 
**Minor Rule**
Rule violations of a minor nature include violations that may affect the continuity, efficiency of safety or work and will not be tolerated if repeated. Minor rule violations may result in either verbal or written warnings to the employee; however, repeated violations could lead to suspension and possibly termination. The following are examples of minor rule violations that may result in either verbal or written warnings to the employee:
 
on school days during school hours, unless an employment certificate has been issued by the school district superintendent (see Minnesota Statutes 181A.05) and the worker is allowed to work during school hours under federal law.
 
By state law, 16- and 17-year old high school students may not work after 11 p.m. on evenings before school days or before 5 a.m. on school days. With written permission from a parent or guardian, these hours may be expanded to 11:30 p.m. and 4:30 a.m. No other limit is set for the hours that 16- and 17-year-olds can work. High school graduates who are 17 years old do not have work hour restrictions.
 
Employers are generally subject to both state child labor laws and the federal child labor provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Certain Minnesota child labor laws are more protective than federal law and vice versa. Employers covered by both Minnesota child labor laws and the federal FLSA must follow the most protective provisions that apply to their employees. Visit www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/child-labor for more information about federal child labor law.
 
The youth employment provisions of the Wage and Hour Act are designed to protect minors by restricting the types of jobs and the number of hours they may work. North Carolina law adopts the federal employment standards for youths between the ages of 14- and 17-years old, employed in non-farm jobs, as well as the exceptions to those limitations; however, the Wage and Hour Act establishes some additional, more stringent requirements that must be followed by all non-farm employers. Farm work is completely exempt from any of the provisions of the North Carolina Wage and Hour Act. Employment in hazardous or detrimental occupations are not permitted for youths under the age of 18.
 
Complaints regarding youth employment may be made anonymously. However, due to the information that is required to be obtained prior to investigating a complaint, all complaints (including anonymous complaints) must be made by calling 1-800-NCLABOR (1-800-625-2267).
 
The N.C. Department of Labor adopts administrative rules, which provide further information regarding enforcement of the act. The rules for the Wage and Hour Act can be found at the Office of Administrative Hearings website.

The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) establishes minimum wage, overtime pay, recordkeeping, and youth employment standards affecting employees in the private sector and in Federal, State, and local governments. Covered nonexempt workers are entitled to a minimum wage of not less than $7.25 per hour effective July 24, 2009. Overtime pay at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate of pay is required after 40 hours of work in a workweek.
 
Starting in 2016, agencies across the federal government must adjust their penalties for inflation each year. Below is a table that reflects the adjustments that have occurred for penalties under this statute. For more information on the penalty adjustments, go here.

If you want to know more take a look at How Google Sold Its Engineers on Management by David A Garvin, from the Harvard Business Review. Recently, findings from another Google project, Aristotle, on the attributes of high performing teams are discussed in a well-written piece in the New York Times.
 
Bock and Google have a specific philosophy with regard to rewards. They reward value-creation and high performers like anyone else. And they reward proportionally like many do. But their view of the performance distribution is different to many (explained below). The upshot is that they reward the really high performers really highly, with the bonus money spread across fewer employees than others might. Why? Because the really high performers are the ones you need to keep.
 
In terms of the graphs, the power law curve allows performance to extend to much higher levels (the graph goes out further to the right). And, therefore, there are more people represented by the shaded area in the second graph when compared with the equivalent area in the first graph (the area under the curve to the right of the blue line). Importantly, the average line on the right hand graph is closer to the y-axis (lower performance level) than the one on the left hand curve. For our organisation this means that there are more employees who are performing higher multiples than the average than we realise because of our false beliefs about the performance distribution. And this in turn means that we underestimate just how high performing the really higher performers are doing. And to address this, Google sets the higher performance bar much higher, paying fewer employees higher amounts. At another company, you might spread that money more evenly across more employees without fully realising what you are doing. If you are losing your really top people then it might be because you are undervaluing them.

Under the new standard adopted in Stericycle, the General Counsel must prove that a challenged rule has a reasonable tendency to chill employees from exercising their rights. If the General Counsel does so, then the rule is presumptively unlawful. However, the employer may rebut the presumption by proving that the rule advances a legitimate and substantial business interest and that the employer is unable to advance that interest with a more narrowly tailored rule. If the employer proves its defense, then the work rule will be found lawful to maintain. In line with this framework, the Board rejected the categorical approach of Boeing in favor of case-specific consideration of work rules.
 
Established in 1935, the National Labor Relations Board is an independent federal agency that protects employees from unfair labor practices and protects the right of private sector employees to join together, with or without a union, to improve wages, benefits and working conditions. The NLRB conducts hundreds of workplace elections and investigates thousands of unfair labor practice charges each year.
 
Have spend many a day working on getting syntax correct for Attribute Rules in ArcPro to be able to publish a map/feature service to our enterprise portal for use in a web app. Rules work as expected in ArcPro, but do not seem to be working in either Smart Editor or Editor widgets. Nor do they work in the web map while editing.
