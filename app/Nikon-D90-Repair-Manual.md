Does anyone know where I can download a repair guide for my 18-200? It stopped working all of a sudden, no autofocus or f adjustment, basically dead.
I managed to get it apart and noticed the ribbon cable from the cpu cotacts was not attatched, may have happened in a slight fall before it died ( more than likeley) but can I hell get this cable back in, just doesnt seem to have enough room to manipulate it back where it belongs.
Not interested in sending to Nikon for repair as it will no doubt cost more than the thing is worth as its out of warranty.
Any help / links greatly appreciated.

I'd love to see such a manual myself. I used to have diagrams of the guts but lost the file and cannot figure out where I originally got it from.

I can probably help you with this problem though. The ribbon cables are clamped in. If you look carefully on each side of the slot it fits into, there is a small tab sticking out. Pull out on those tabs parallel to the board, about 1 or 2 mm. Slide the cable in, then push the tabs back into place.

hi.. i am also in need of a manual.

 i had dropped the 18-200 too.
then recently when my computer crashed and had to do long hours of software update, i kept myself busy with fixing the 18-200. it now at least zooms and all, takes photos too. 
but somewhere I must have put something wrong and the auto focus is not able to stop searching for the focus point.
I want to use the manual to check where my 'fix' went wrong.

can someone help with a manual? (itekguc [at] yahoo (dot] com).

I've never seen the DP2 service manual posted anywhere other than that Italian trading website, which has listed it as "sold" every time I've looked. It may be worth trying to contact the seller to see if he has any more, given it was advertised as a photocopy of the original 33 page repair manual for 5 euro.
 
Be aware that Nikon revised the DP2 guts something like 17 times in four years, because they were getting killed with warranty repair claims. They issued supplementary service bulletins to cover each revision, which may or may not be included with any baseline DP2 service manual you can find.
 
It is also worth considering that the DP2 contains first-generation, near 50 year old prehistoric camera electronics. Early Nikon meter prisms are notorious for circuit boards that crumble upon removal from their housing, and cold solder joints that can be nightmare difficult to fix. There's a reason Sover Wong charges a small fortune to repair the DP2 and offer a proper warranty: its a very dicey proposition to open one up.
 
If you acquired this DP2 for little or no money and have nothing to lose tearing it apart, maybe its worth the effort. But if its your primary camera, think about having Sover repair it properly. Better yet, invest the money in a newer more reliable DP3 (SB) or DP12 (AS) prism with updated electronics, low drain LEDs, and indestructible silicon blue metering cells. The DP2 was Nikon's longest-running prototype, masquerading as a finished product.

I wonder if you could please help me with a pdf repair manual or a picture of the wiring diagram for the circuit board that is connected to the shutter release switch? The wiring diagram is in the repair manual but an ordinary picture of a circuit board with the cables attached is also OK.
 
@ostlind this is going to be tough since we cannot see which PCB this is and where the wires are coming from or going to. A total view of the board would help, but I can imagine that it will be a PITA to completely remove it. Something like this
 
Anyhow, this will definitely help you out since it contains everything you need md12sm.pdf Make sure that you create a couple of guides when you repair this. It will come in handy for other people looking for answers like you.
 
There's a guy on this forum and on the Super 8mm facebook group named Kirk Billingsly (I think that's his last name....) who can repair R10 and R8s. He does it for fun actually. So search around for his name and hit him up.
 
As far as manual exposure, what you were doing before is right. But if you want to use a manual meter, I'd meter for a slightly slower speed then use that. So 40ASA for 50D, 160 for 200T and 400 for 500T. 180 is a slower shutter than 160 so that shouldn't matter too much. As you said, negative stock always likes more light. You can really overexpose and you'll be fine. Or just use a light meter app like I do (or a more updated actual meter) and you can set the shutter speed to be more exact as well as the ASA. Negative film has a lot of latitude so a third under or over will be ok but generally I'd recommend to go over if you have a choice.
 
Kirk recommended contacting Phil V. at Pro8mm , but I think I read somewhere on Facebook ( Super 8mm group or Pro8mm User Group ) that Phil said he won't work on Nikons because it's too much of a hassle to open them up . I'll have to contact him to find out if he's changed his mind about that (or maybe he found a Nikon specialist in L.A. who will do the work ?) .
 
I have a Nikon R10 with the same problem, but mine doesn't move at all. I was going to fix it myself since I had one before and I was able to make it work, but if somebody already have the process figured out and the parts I wouldn't mind having that person doing it right instead of me experimenting with the camera.
 
I'm going to have to contact him to see if he still works on these cameras . Since he recommended that I contact someone else I'm guessing he either doesn't do it anymore or he's too busy. Here's what he wrote on the Super 8 group on Facebook:
 
Page 33 [of the repair manual] you will see highlights regarding the EE Servo. The R10 and R8 for that matter both suffer from frozen meter needle. I have found that the cause is the hardening of the vintage lubrication and long periods of not using the camera attribute to this. The needle sway arm will actually set in place and the lubrication as it ages hardens and acts as an adhesive holding the needle stationary. Using dental tools, I have been able to delicately remove this, clean with isopropyl alcohol and re-grease. The key is to take your time and be patient. The only negative thing in working on Nikon R8/10's is the skin is very hard to remove compared to a Canon Super. No matter how delicate you are removing it and how well you re-adhere it, it never looks the same.
 
On the Facebook group he posted the R10 repair manual . But I don't know if I'm brave enough to open it up myself . I'm really looking for someone who has done this before and knows what they are doing.
 
I don't know the guy but from what I've seen, I think he's more of a "teach a man to fish" kinda guy. But perhaps if you just say you mean business and won't jerk him around, he might do it. I think since he's was doing it as a hobby thing, he doesn't want to start a whole repair business per se.
 
I've just got to try it , do my bracketed exposures, then adjust based on those tests. I've done this before with 16mm . Don't know why I'm such a chicken using manual exposure with an external light meter for Super-8 ... I've shot 16mm with my Cine Kodak K-100 and my Bolex H16 , manual exposure , using an external meter , those films turned out fine. I think in the past with Super-8 I've always depended on the internal meter and let it be casual, "worry free" shooting , which is part of what draws me back to shooting Super-8 , that wonderful ability to just pop a cartridge in the camera and go shoot. If I think of all the cameras I've used , my happiest experiences have been using the Nikon R8 or R10 Super-8mm , Canon 514 XL Super-8mm , Cine Kodak K-100 16mm . (honorable mention to Yashica LD-8 Super-8 camera , which has always worked fine with the right lighting conditions, BUT doesn't have manual exposure or an EE Lock (like the Canon 514) , so it's only auto-exposure and you're at the mercy of the light .)
 
Wow that is great! That repair manual has a lot of extremely detailed information. As I mentioned before I had another R10 like 5 years ago with exactly the same problem, I tried to find someone to fix it and I couldn't find anyone so I decided to give it a try myself. I do some work on my cameras and some photo cameras, so I did it. It's not really difficult but you have to remove the cover on top of the knobs and since they are made of aluminum they bend and they don't look the same. You have to remove the leatherette and since it has been there for 40 years it's hard to do it without damaging it, even if you do it really carefully the leatherette is going to stretch and it won't fit the same later.
 
After that you remove a few screws and you can pretty much see the mechanism and it is pretty obvious to figure how it works. The problem is there is a rounded piece made out of rubber and after 40 years they just "liquify" they look like asphalt, very sticky and black. In order to make the camera work I had to replicate the part but that part moves some small pieces made out of copper and those are the ones that open or close the aperture. That same rubber part is connected to a small motor which is the one that controls the auto aperture, so if you can fix one you are fixing the two modes.
 
I made the camera work, but the part that I made kept falling, I kept replacing it and at some point I broke one of those copper parts and that was it. I sold the camera for parts on eBay. Around a month ago I got another one and this one is in like new condition, but with the same problem. Now that I have the repair manual (I have to study it) I'm going to try to replicate the part in a better way, maybe get it 3D printed or something. I'm going to document (video) the process and if I can find a good w
