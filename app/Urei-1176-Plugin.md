Attack sets the time it takes the 1176 to respond to incoming signal, while Release sets the time it takes the 1176 to return to its initial level. The VU meter displays the amount of gain reduction (GR) or output level (+4/+8).

I was lucky to use an 1176 back in the 80's, primarily for radio promos and concert spots. The flexibility of the ratios, the simplicity in dialing in the sound, was an amazing moment of discovery.
Forward 40 years, still doing spots and promos. And amazingly, the 1176 "three-pack" plug-in's, offer all those options, and more-including the noticeable coloration differences.
Salute! to Bill Sr.'s genius, and to Bill Jr. and the family for continuing the legacy of UA's sound !
 
These plug-ins are insanely accurate, to the point where most people would not know the difference between this plug-in and the real thing. I A physical 1176 and have a beat them and found there to be very little difference. An excellent plug-in that everyone should own.
 
This collection of 1176 comps is an indispensable tool for anyone who mixes drums, bass and guitar. It's already on my list of favorite plugins, along with Teletronix LA-2A Leveler Collection and Ocean Way Studios
 
Before purchasing this, I had only ever used stock compressors, and even then, I had only used them sparingly, as I had never noticed any significant effect apart from limiting. That all changed when I decided to take a chance on this plug-in and see why I had seen "1176" in just about every mixing discussion I'd ever heard or read. The very moment I hit play after throwing this on a vocal track, my entire perspective on compressors changed. The grit and presence I'd been hearing for years on countless records instantly revealed itself to me, and I was floored--absolutely beautiful tone. I have since gone on a deep dive into compressors and eq's, realizing what I had been missing out on for far too long.
I love this tone on my vocals; it fattens up my kick drum; pulls the grinding body of a cello to the forefront; brightens or delightfully swamps up a banjo; and with some more experimental instrumentation, it grabs onto sounds and noises you thought were lost in the recording and throws them back into the mix in a big, haunting way. I absolutely love this set of plugins; it literally made me a better producer by showing me why people call compressors "tone boxes," as the 1176 is all tone, color, and character.
 
terrible customer service, when you buy plugins they don't belong to you at all. If you buy multiple interfaces in particular, you cannot transfer any of the plugins with them unless you completely leave the uad system. the worst.
 
The 1176 classic limiter collection is a must have. Snappy compression with distinctive colour, and so versatile with it. I use this to tame just about anything, but especially on vocals and snare drums. The interface is simple and easy to use.
 
Seeing as the Origin Effects Cali 76 (about 280) basically replicates the original 1970's Universal Audio Urei 1176 in pedal form ( ), and now Universal Audio themselves are making a 1176 in a pedal available at GAK for 178 it seems a bargain........However, that's if it works as hoped and a company isn't just trading off the good name of past glories. It isn't analogue, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but there are plenty of digital emulations about so it all depends on how good the emulation is.

Unfortunately, the Universal Audio Max Compressor (which I assume uses the same software) has this negative Bass review: -audio-max-compressor-review but perhaps that is because of the preamp making Bass signals clip, the 1176 and LA2A don't have that preamp so perhaps don't have the same issue. I'll be keeping an eye on this thread: -audio-max-dual-compressor-preamp-pedal.1603504/page-8
 
I'm particularly interested in the LA-2A. I have the Cali76, and I think it's taught me that I like the prefer the more subtle fattening style of compression that LA2A type circuits are potentially better for.
 
At the risk of being "that guy"... I can't work out why they've gone the digital route with these! Surely a recreation in pedal format would've had more appeal (and better results I can imagine) than a digital interpretation .
 
I was "that" guy for years, ie. generally sniffy about digital stuff. Then started experimenting with more recent digital gear (Meris stuff, Eventide H9, Source Audio's latest offerings etc) and my mind's been well and truly blown!
 
Personally I've had digital stuff (Line 6 HX stomp, Hotone Ampero II Stomp, various zoom iterations, Ampeg SGT DI with digital IR loader, source audio aftershock and bass OFD, TC Spectracomp etc) and they always lack a certain body and harmonic content.
 
That being said, I may love it if I try it; I know local players who are far better than me who have this and love what it does... I currently use a Source Audio Ultrawave and C4, so am not 100% anti digital; I just think it lends itself to certain application, and this is one of those where I can't understand why they haven't stayed true or closer to the source material.
 
Yeah, I've had similar - digital overdrives/distortions and compressors (and octavers and envelope filters) never quite match up to their analogue counterparts for me, digital modulation and delays are great though. To just listen to two sound clips A/B it's be very had to tell the difference with many, but actually playing them there seems to be a very slightly different feel - something a bit uncanny, perhaps too uniform/predictable without subtle quirks, perhaps a tiny delay due to processing time, sample rates not being high enough to completely fool you into thinking it's the same as analogue, or perhaps that the emulation just reacts and sounds a bit different? Or probably the most likely is my personal bias and preconceptions!
 
I thought the Source Audio Atlas was really good - the thing that let it down for me wasn't the sound, it was the hardware (fiddly 'alt' button to access controls for a few seconds - wait a second too long and you end up adjusting the wrong thing, not great for live tweaking), so I'm certainly not against digital compressors in principle.
 
Comparing my 4k raw video and WAV audio with the YouTube version always makes me a bit sad. I get it and the reasons why it is this way, but having put so much effort in to the nuances of the sound and visuals, viewers aren't getting the full "effect" if you excuse the pun!
 
Is that how it works though? (Genuine question, I don't know). Can a company basically put a digital VST plugin into a digital pedal? The pedal doesn't have the same processor, RAM, digital architecture etc as a computer (although I guess some of the expensive multi fx might). Isn't it equivalent to 'Mercedes make good F1 engines so the new Mercedes van will have a good engine'.
 
I'm still on the fence though. A bit of a negative guitar review here, good reviews here and here. Negateve Talkbass thread about the UA Max clipping issue, but someone on a Talkbass thread that has a Cali 76, and Hyper Luminal, AND two of the original 1176 and highly rates the new UAFX 1176.
 
I had a long discussion with a brand a while ago about two pieces of hardware they were selling. Both devices appeared to have the same menus system and library of effects. The more expensive device could run three effects at once (a physically larger unit too) whilst the cheaper and much smaller device could run five. Did this make the cheaper device the better unit? Despite the architecture being similar, the "programs" running were less detailed and presented less load on the processor in the cheaper device, thus it was able to run more "effects" at once. To misquote Mr Malmsteen, sometimes "more is more" is, well.. not..
