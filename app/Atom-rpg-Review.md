I rarely feel so conflicted, and so rarely do my usual likes and dislikes turn on their head so abruptly. ATOM RPG has changed me. I don't know what I expected from the game going in, but experiencing it has changed the way I think about games like this. Living the life of a sole wanderer in a wasteland far harsher than the survival modes in most survival games has made me appreciate the slow moments, the heartwarming conversations, and the friends we make along the way - because sometimes you're best off just staying with friends.
 
ATOM RPG is a truly fascinating cRPG inspired by the classic Fallout games, and those old PC titles your dad mentions whenever it's his time to rant about how he was a gamer when he was young, too. Every part of the aesthetic of ATOM RPG is inspired, in some way, by the Fallout games past and present. The green glow of your inventory and text windows is reminiscent of the Pipboy, and even the title screen includes a shot of a wanderer marching off into the distance, a shot which was made iconic by games like Fallout 3 and 4. This game knows what it wants to be, and is directly courting fans of the genre.
 
The thing is, ATOM RPG has already done this successfully. You can currently buy the game on Steam for an affordable price, and people really enjoy this retro-styled adventure. But I'm playing on Nintendo Switch, which is bound to be a very, very different experience, and that experience differs right from the tutorial.

Genuinely, the menus in this game are quite possibly the least intuitive I've ever seen in a console game. I'm sure you're mentally scanning for infamous examples of something worse, like Mass Effect's absurd inventory management, or Final Fantasy XIV's MMO interface crushed down into a controller. But no, ATOM RPG has the worst menus of any consoles game I've ever played - and the reason is simple. The developers clearly put work into making these menus look stylish and work well on PC. That makes perfect sense - but moving a mouse cursor around the screen to drag, highlight, and interact with items is completely different from using a controller. And when you take these designed-for-PC menus and slap them onto a Nintendo Switch, it's a bad result, especially when playing in handheld mode, where you'll be struggling to read the text and see what is actually in your bag.
 
I spent genuine hours - genuine hours - playing the game before I understood in detail how to actually navigate my menus, equip items, use them, and use them in battle. On that note, I found a rusted machete and it broke after killing just one ugly giant spider mutant, so I shall be hearing no more complaints about weapon durability in Breath of the Wild. The point I'm getting at is that this game is brutally, devastatingly obtuse, and I don't think that would be the case on PC at all. The control system and user interface the game was designed for does a lot of the heavy lifting when it comes to understanding it.
 
Notice how this review has spent such a long amount of time talking about menus and interfaces? That's because while playing this game on Nintendo Switch, those issues are constant. But when you finally sink into a flow and rhythm, finally begin understanding the game, things begin to click into place. Nothing in this game clicks quite like the towns and characters you meet in them. I was about ready to never play this game again, right up until I arrived at the first proper village, and everything changed. Every character in the village was well-written and fascinating.
 
Genuinely the dialogue and characters you can talk to in this game are excellent. Genuinely excellent. They all have distinct, at-times cartoonish personalities, all affected by what surrounds them, all with their own individual wants and needs, some satisfied, others not. Talking to characters in the village, and the wanders you meet while exploring the world at large is the highlight of the game for me. It's just a shame when those conversations go south because the combat is yet another aspect that suffers because of the console conversion.
 
When you boil it all down, ATOM RPG is clearly a really fascinating and deep cRPG, which has been entirely butchered in order to fit it onto the Nintendo Switch. This game clearly needs mouse input - or a console conversion which is far more robust - in order to shine. As it stands right now, it's too obtuse to play - not necessarily difficult, just obtuse. Which makes it incredibly hard to recommend.
 
ATOM RPG is a game so clearly designed for mouse and keyboard on PC that you should only play it on Nintendo Switch if you already have experience with the game. Going in as a complete newbie will be a brutal lesson in patience and frustration, and you need the kind of knowledge of how to play and the ease of use that comes with the PC version first. Ultimately, that makes ATOM RPG an interesting, but incredibly difficult game to recommend.
 
If there is one thing I have learned about the post-apocalypse sub-genre it is that you can trust the Eastern Europeans know their stuff, and there is not a more avid fanbase out there. The STALKER video-game series is loosely based off the real-life Chernobyl Disaster as well as the 1971 novel, Roadside Picnic, and the 1979 film aptly named STALKER. These games still are updated with new mods, and the sheer number of mods from Eastern Europe eclipses whatever we�ll see in the West. The Metro series, created by Dmitry Glukhovsky, is both a well-respected international book series as well as a video-game series based on the life below the surface after the apocalypse in Moscow. Finally, with regards to the Fallout franchise, there continues to be new fan-made expansions such as Fallout: Nevada or the development of Fallout: Sonora. Needless to say, and there are dozens of other examples you could mention from various media, if the world comes to nuclear annihilation there is one half of the world better prepared to deal with the reality of the situation. 

Now generalizations are not facts nor are they meant to act as evidence; it would be more correct to state they are trends viewed from an outsider�s perspective, sometimes more rooted in truth than mere coincidence. Off the top of my head, I can think of various Eastern European authors with no relation to this genre such as Anton Chekhov (The Lady with the Dog), Sergei Dovlatov (The Suitcase) or Andrzej Sapkowski (The Witcher book series.) The sheer prevalence of these mods and fan-made works might also be rationalized by the scarcity and the cost of new games, so, as a result, these players have greater attachment to their games than Western audiences. However, given the vast number of post-apocalypse mods since the 1990s�especially for staples like Fallout�there is perhaps greater cultural significance to this genre because of the aftereffects of Chernobyl and the collapse of the USSR. Similar to the weird obsession Western audiences have to zombie media and the emphasis on consuming them like mindless hordes�oh, look, a late-Memorial Day sale on cheaply produced consumer goods to fuel my capitalistic desires; what was I talking about again? Oh, right, ATOM RPG.

Pseudo-philosophical discussions of art aside, ATOM RPG is more than a mere homage to the Fallout games it clearly took inspiration from; the game itself is as much a satirical celebration of the post-apocalypse fandom as a loosely-inspired parallel to the real anguish during the Cold War. Does this statement mean ATOM RPG is political? No, unless having fun and cracking jokes about past events are damnable offenses, comrade; there are political overtones such as hyperbolic statements of communism like in Fallout, but there are no overt messages. The game, as much as the message itself, is a Wasteland of our past with no clear meaning but �A heap of broken images, where the sun beats� (line 22.) What you can be certain of is that you�ll always come away with a smile if you can see past the game at its worst to relish another moment when it outshines its inspirations.

**It Don�t Mean A Thing, Comrade, If It Ain�t Got Stalin�**

If you have any background knowledge of classic RPGs, then the video�s opening as well as the usage of reverse-psychology should immediately inform you ATOM RPG is a spiritual successor to the Classic Fallout titles. The real question to ask is, �Which Fallout or Wasteland game, if any, does ATOM best imitate, and what sets this game from its predecessors or its current competition?�

From the SPECIAL or CLASSIC character sheets and the Wasteland 2 UI aesthetic, the differences should be immediately apparent that ATOM did not simply rehash these older games without learning from some of their mistakes. Like Fallout 1 and 2, ATOM is a single-party-member (with �suggestions� for teammates) CRPG with all the problems inherited from before. As someone who didn�t like playing the original Fallouts for this one reason, my two problems with this system remain the same: You don�t have total control during combat, which adds too much luck to my liking, and the lack of cover-mechanics makes the �strategy� feel more like exploiting the AI�s sight-lines.

This first limitation has been somewhat addressed with the Quality of Life update, providing you various co
