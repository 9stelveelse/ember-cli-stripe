Over that period of time I have purchased over $500 worth of expansions. I know one expansion was bought on a different account than the others (not sure if that matters or not). Is there any possibly way to get the expansion I already purchased on my mac because there is no way I am spending all that money on things i've already bought.

@KoolNoodle669 Unfortunately, there's no way to share or transfer your content from the XBox version of Sims 4 to a PC install. The two are considered different games in many ways, including the fact that you need to buy content for each separately. I'm sure it's not what you want to hear, but all Sims 4 expansion packs, along with the Vampires game pack and Spooky Stuff SP are currently 50% off in Origin. The sale ends November 1st at 10 am U.S Pacific time.
 
Please make sure that your mods and custom content are fully updated before installing. Outdated content can cause all kinds of glitches and even corrupt your saves beyond repair. Any decent mod creator will list an update history, and you can check it to confirm that the content is compatible with the current patch level. It's also a good idea to back up your game folder before adding new content. That way, if something goes wrong, you can just trash the new folder and put the old one back with no permanent harm done.
 
The Sims 4 has released a huge amount of DLCs (downloadable content) for the Xbox, which totally enriches the lives of your Sims. There are now (including all smaller game packs and kits) about 48 expansions for the Sims 4 on Xbox. Among these, there are the following 11 big expansion packs:
 
Do you love meeting new Sims and being part of a club? Then we have some good news for you. Because with The Sims 4: Get Together you can create your own club! Start a book club or a dance club, for example. You can set up the rules of the club, select the members and organise meetings. You can even select your own club logo and secret handshake.

In our opinion, we think you can get the best Sims job ever with this expansion! Launch your new interactive acting career and join your Sims on the movie set. Here you can complete certain interactions to gain big promotions in your acting career. With your help, your Sims will be superstars in no time!
 
The suburbs of Willow Creek and Oasis Springs are lovely and quiet, but sometimes you just want to feel the buzz and rush of the big city. The Sims 4: City Living offers your Sims the opportunity to explore the bustling City of San Myshuno!
 
Visit the Fashion District or the Arts Quarter, sing your heart out at the Karaoke Bar and beat your friends in a game of basketball. In The Sims 4: City Living you'll also be able to visit a variety of cool cultural festivals, like the Romance Festival and the Spice Festival, where you can join the flaming-hot Curry Challenge. Cut deals with the guys behind the food stands and learn how to cook dozens of new dishes!
 
The Sims 4: Discover University expansion pack did not make it to our top 5, but we want you to know; we really REALLY love this expansion! With this pack, you can actually send your Sims off to college. This way, they can avoid having to start their careers as dishwashing assistants. How cool is that?
 
Besides studying, your Sims can play juice pong, chill with classmates and organise epic college parties. They can also join debate teams, art clubs or a secret society. It may sound clich, but with The Sims 4: Student Life, college truly is the best time of your life!
 
The Sims 4: Discover University expansion pack comes with a new world, also known as Britechester. In this world you'll find the Historic University of Britechester, the modern Foxbury institute and Gibbs Hill - the neighbourhood where you'll find several (student) houses.
 
In The Sims 4: Eco Lifestyle, your actions (and how you build your homes) can have an impact on the climate as well as on your neighbourhood. Each week, your Sims can vote for the neighbourhood action plan that's most important to them. You can also install wind turbines, solar panels, and dew collectors around the house, or grow your own food - vertically!
 
Are you ready to reduce, reuse and recycle? Then we have some good news for you. Because you can buy The Sims 4: Eco Lifestyle for the Xbox at Startselect! Did you know that buying products at Startselect is always eco-friendly? Our products are digital - and therefore not wrapped in plastic. What are you waiting for?
 
The new world of The Sims 4: Snowy Escape is based on two Japanese islands, named Hanshu and Hokkaido. It has three areas: Yukimatsu, Senbamachi and Wakaba. You can build new houses, move into pre-built homes or visit cosy holiday cottages.
 
Unfortunately, just like in real life, your best friend can become ill. Luckily, you can go visit a veterinary clinic - or start one yourself! Build an awesome high tech clinic and develop your veterinary skills, so you can diagnose and cure all the sweet animals of your neighbourhood!
 
Are you ready to add some cute furry friends to your Sims households? Then we have a special offer for you. Because at Startselect you can purchase a bundle including The Sims 4: Cats and Dogs + My First Pet! In just a few clicks you can add a kitten, puppy or guinea pig (My First Pet) to your Sims household!
 
Always imagined yourself living in the countryside, with a llama or a cow grazing away in the meadow, some (sometimes angry) chickens and the possibility of being completely self-sufficient? Do you want to make friends with birds, rabbits, foxes just like a Disney-princess? Then make your dreams come true with The Sims 4: Cottage Living
 
In The Sims 4: Cottage Living you can build your own farm with authentic wooden furniture and lovely wallpapers. You can also help the residents of Henford-on-Bagley in order to receive unique items. Enter your home-grown oversized fruit and vegetables into the Finchwick Fair contest, or bring your most handsome llama in order to compete! Other things you can do in The Sims 4: Cottage Living:
 
With this expansion, you can settle down in a new world called Henford-on-Bagley. The area is inspired by the beautiful countryside of the United Kingdom. You'll have several empty houses to move into, one empty lot and even a rental where your Sims can go on the perfect countryside holiday.

So I just got a new computer and have been trying to download things last night. The sims 4 base game did download but now none of my purchased packs will download. They have been perpetually in the preparing stage.
