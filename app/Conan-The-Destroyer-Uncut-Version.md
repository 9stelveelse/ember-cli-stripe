I would like the dvd to have the supplements from Legend and the cover box snap case like Conan The Barbarian. I would like to see the dvd cover with the poster at the top of this page. It was the advance poster for Conan The Destroyer.
 
When Conan The Destroyer was released in theatre in summer of 1984, There was also a novelization/book based on the second Conan movie. It was written by Robert Jordan. With most books, there are scenes that are not in the movie, but in the book, and Conan is no exception. The book does talk about Sarah favorite scenes, including the love scene between Conan and Queen Taramis. I would highly recommend checking out the book based on Conan The Destroyer. It will give you an idea what to expect from the uncut version of Conan The Destroyer. There are two versions of the Conan The Destroyer book, one with Arnold on the cover (see above) and the other with the Conan artwork. I see the Arnold cover on EBay from time to time.

2004 also marks the 20th Anniversary of Conan The Destroyer. It would very cool to release this new version of Conan The Destroyer during the 20th Anniversary year. Plus with Arnold being Governor of California, and not making movies for the next few years. It would be a treat for the fans to be able to see more of Arnold in the sequel to Conan The Barbarian.
 
I have been working on getting the uncut version of Conan The Destroyer released on dvd for a few years now. I could not have done this Conan The Destroyer alone and I want to thank the following for helping me with this petition:
 
Sarah Douglas, Grace Jones, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Greg Carson, Mike Coate, Van Ling, Jim Kathan, Randy Jennings, Katie Biggs, Charlie de Lauzirika, JM Kenny, Colleen Benn, Laurent Bouzereau, Josh Davidson, Mori, Garth Franklin, Bruno Tapia, QTN, The Conan Movies Fans, The Arnold Fans, The Sarah Douglas Fans, The Home Theatre Forum, Future DVDS, MGM/20th Century Fox International, and of course Universal Studios.
 
UPDATED: If you can't phone Universal, then you can e-mail them atuniversalstudios&dreamworks@leemarketing.com. Ask for the se of Conan The Destroyer uncut. I am still working on getting the uncut version of Conan The Destroyer released on Region 1 DVD. There is a customer service number for Universal Pictures/Home Video 972-293-5903.
 
In 1984, Arnold returned as Conan in Conan The Destroyer. The studio wanted to release a gentler Conan and made the film rated PG. It backfired, and none of the fans were happy with the cuts including myself. Even Arnold has stated that it was a mistake. Arnold would later have major success with the first Terminator movie. After that film, he never had to do another Conan film.
 
Sarah Douglas has always been my favorite actress since Superman 2. She was just amazing as the Evil but beautiful Ursa who hated men and wanted to destroy the world. She certainly made life difficult for Superman. Of course Sarah had a great breakthrough performance for her role as Ursa. She would later become famous for playing villains. She has done a great job doing that.

While she was filming Conan The Destroyer, she would fly from Mexico to Burbank, Ca to film the nighttime soap opera Falcon Crest. She would fly back and fourth between the two jobs. She was certainly busy during those days.
 
There are two items that she mentioned to me. First was that character was never kidnapped so she could do the Conan Movie. She would travel back and fourth. The Falcon Crest producers gave her special permission to do both. Second: She never did a nude scene with Arnold. She was able to keep her clothes on during the love scene. This is what Sarah told me about scenes from Conan. " Don't know where anyone got the idea that I did nude work!! Far from it...I am way to British and conservative!! I was fully clad in Conan and even had my crown on during love scene with Arnold!!" Regardless of this news. I am still interested in the uncut version.
 
I have had alot of major success with this Unofficial Site on Sarah Douglas. I have met so many people, both fans, and friends, and even family. They all like this site very much. They learn more about Sarah from this site then anywhere else. I even had Sarah respond to a few questions here and there. When I started this site, I wanted to know about a couple of items. I wanted to know what happened to Jack O'Halloran. He was MIA since 1994. I certainly found out what happened to him. He is a great guy and I have helped him connect with both Terence and Sarah. I also got to see a very rare movie that Sarah did back in 1977. Her first leading role called The Brute. Its one of her best roles. I am glad that I got to see it.
 
Those items were easy compared to getting the uncutConan The Destroyer released on dvd. I have been petitioning at the home theater for the uncut version of Conan. I have had many people sign up for it. I want to thank everyone who has posted and saying that they want the uncut version. I also got great news that there is going to be a region 2 SE release of Conan The Destroyer on dvd. A special thanks towww.dvdfile.com Which I hope with this petition, and the future release of Conan region 2.. that anything is possible. This internet is a powerful tool. getting the uncut version of Conan is possible. We just need to show Universal that there is an audience for the film. You might be an Arnold fan, A Conan fan, A Sarah fan, or just a fan of fantasy films. I ask you come and join us as we petition for the uncut version of Conan. We need a least 100 votes or so.
 
Over at the Home Theatre Forum, there is a petition for the UNCUT "R" rated version for Conan The Destroyer. Hopefully if many fans can write and say that they want to see the "R" rated Conan The Destroyer. Many of Sarah's favorite scenes were cut to get a PG rating. This includes a love scene with Arnold. Sarah has mentioned that she was NOT Nude in the love scene with Arnold. I have always wanted to see the uncut version of Conan, ever since I saw the movie. Hopefully Universal will see the post at the home theatre forum and make a new DVD of Conan. You will have to sign up and be members for the home theatre. It's very easy to do. Sarah talks about her cut scenes from Conan in the1986 Starlog Interview. I have had a few fans write to me about getting a copy of the "R" rated version of Conan The Destroyer. This is not just about me. I know that many fans want to see the "R" rated version. Thank you for the support.
 
I recently came across a clip of Conan the Barbarian that was broadcast a long time a go on television networks that was heavily censored but which also contains some unique footage. Perhaps there might be much more unique differences also as I have only seen a small clip.
 
Wow that is very interesting to see. I can recommend website called Conan completist for fans.It has the most detailed information with very rare photos of some scenes that didnt make it into final film.
 
In terms of the way deleted and alternative content works I wish to run through the film and estimation of how much is actually missing. you will have to open the link in a new tab to follow my descriptions on the points.
 
Conan Narration - Concerning the Shot used in Conan the Destroyer taken from Conan the Barbarian footage this does not work over the Mako Narration. Although we have a Black screen for the Narration A snippet of this shot may have been earmarked but assume if there was footage it was World Building and scenery or matte paintings Setting up Hyboria. No time difference swap black screen for footage.
 
The procession - Yes Missing Scene in connection with the lawless world comes a procession showing a different way of life although under the notion of peace is something more sinister. The scene above and this one is all part of the same sequence.
 
Love yurt - Small cuts missing showing each other there Slave collar scars potential Flash back of Valeria pit fighting here. This established what they had in common they came from the same sort of place.
 
King Ozric - Yes shortened Meeting with Max Von Sydow Kings Death is Missing and Snake cult Priest asking for Daughters Hand in Marriage. Also Not mentioned The Minature of King Ozrics Wooden Castle was not Shown in an establishing shot.
 
The Orgy Chamber - I am not so sure that there is So much Time Missing although Alternative Material is at play here (Censorship). Particularly the shot Thogrimm looking in confusion after the Big Pillar falls lingers far too long this replaces Subotai firing an arrow and Conan taking the princess on his shoulders.
 
The Princess - Cuts Shortened scene perhaps stronger for it? This touches on the marriage plot between Thulsa Doom and Yasminia. This was redundant as it would have been covered in the Death of King Ozric Deleted scene.
 
In terms of some other shortening this is natural aside from (James Earl Jones) Thulsa Doom Speech and the Tower of Set Gardens and ascent and Death of King Ozric. The Procession and Pickpocket scene were I would imagine the point of realization that they would assault the Tower of Set, as they were high as kites and that does not tally up so the conscious decision was made upon a hilltop to assault the tower.
 
Please do give your opinions, I think this is probably my favorite film or one of my favorite films and I like it how it is, but I would sincerely love to see it without the silly censorship and properly extended and re-cut.
 
This or American werewolf in London are probably the 2 most sought after uncut versions and Braveheart. That would be around top 3 in my book. But like I said dream preservation uncut pro
