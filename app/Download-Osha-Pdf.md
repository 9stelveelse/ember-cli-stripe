**Verosha Aniseya**, known as **Osha** and nicknamed **Oshie** by her sister, was a Force-sensitive human female Sith acolyte who lived during the High Republic Era. Created via the Force by her mother with the aid of a vergence on the planet Brendok, she was raised as part of a coven of witches alongside her twin sister, Mae-ho "Mae" Aniseya. After Mae started a fire in the coven's fortress in order to prevent Osha from going with four Jedi who had discovered their coven, most of the witches, including Osha's mother, were killed by the Jedi. Osha was rescued by Jedi Master Sol and brought to Coruscant where the Jedi Council reluctantly permitted her training despite her advanced age.

At the Jedi Temple, Osha was taken on as Sol's Padawan but failed to control her negative feelings towards her sister for the deaths of her family. For these reasons, and at the recommendation of the Council, as well as Master Indara who had been on the original mission to Brendok, Osha left the Order and, by 132 BBY, was a meknek for the Trade Federation. After Mae resurfaced and murdered Master Indara on Ueda, Osha was initially blamed and arrested by the Jedi for the crime.
 
However, Osha was quickly absolved of the crime on Olega after Mae killed Master Torbin, leading to the twins' reunion and Osha to team up with her former Jedi Master to bring her sister to justice. Over the course of the investigation, Sol's role in the murder of the twin's mother was gradually revealed, leading a betrayed Osha to fall to the dark side of the Force and kill her former master. She then accepted the invitation of a Sith known simply as "The Stranger" to become his Sith apprentice, parting ways with Mae after the latter had her mind voluntarily erased by the Sith.
 
Aniseya, the leader of a coven of witches, created Osha and Mae[4] around 156 BBY[2] using a mysterious power. Koril carried and bore them; both women were considered to be the girls' mothers.[4] They were brought up on the planet Brendok,[1] where the coven lived in a secret fortified village that was in hiding from the Republic and the Jedi Order. They were the only two children in the village. Their mothers cared deeply for their daughters but argued over how to raise them: Aniseya's desire to show lenience clashed with Koril's more strict approach.[4]
 
Aniseya trained Osha and Mae in the ways of the coven, teaching them to join together to harness the power of the Force, which they called "the Thread". But Osha was reluctant; unlike Mae, she dreamed of a life beyond Brendok, despite her mother's warnings. She often spent time alone under a bunta tree outside the walls. She recorded her private thoughts and dreams in a journal that she did not let her sister see.[4]
 
In 148 BBY,[6] when the twins were eight years old,[1] they were to become witches in the coven's Rite of Ascension. Osha told her mother that she did not want to go, but Aniseya and Mae insisted. Osha went along, if reluctantly. The ceremony began, and Aniseya performed the rite that made Mae a witch. At that moment, a group of Jedi Knights began breaking into the fortress before Aniseya could complete Osha's ascension.[4]
 
Back inside, Osha saw her sister not acting herself. Upset that Osha wanted to abandon the coven, Mae suddenly threatened to kill her before locking her in her room. Mae picked up her journal and saw that Osha had drawn a version of the Jedi symbol inside it. She lit the journal on fire and allowed the flames to engulf the surrounding area. As the fire spread, Osha hot-wired a hatch to a tunnel and escaped. Elsewhere in the fortress, the main generator blew, damaging a bridge through its central cavern. On the bridge, Osha encountered Mae, who seemed not to understand what was happening.[4] The bridge gave out, and Osha believed, falsely,[1] that this killed her sister. But Sol saw Osha falling and reached out with the Force to save her. The fire consumed the rest of the village, killing everyone inside.[4] For many years after, Osha would blame Mae for the destruction of their home and family and thought her dead until Mae's later reappearance as a mysterious assassin.[7]
 
Sol had formed a bond with Osha and now took her on as his apprentice.[7] The Jedi flew her back to Coruscant to begin her training.[4] Some Jedi opposed Sol's decision, both because Osha was older than most Jedi younglings and because her strong attachment to her lost loved ones would be incredibly difficult to overcome. But the Jedi Council decided to accept her.[1]

Osha trained for the next ten years in the Jedi Temple.[3] She befriended her fellow Padawan Yord Fandar.[1] Training was difficult for her, and as some Masters had worried, she struggled to accept the loss of her family years before. She decided to leave the Order[7] around 138 BBY.[8]
 
With no training outside the Jedi Order, she began to work as a meknek, finding that her Force talents could serve well in this dangerous, illegal work. Osha bunked from ship to ship, taking freelance jobs around the CorpSec, including for the Trade Federation. During this time she acquired a small repair droid whom she called Pip[1] and got a tattoo one night while celebrating with her crewmates.[7]
 
In 132 BBY,[9] the Jedi Master Indara was murdered on Ueda by an assassin who looked exactly like Osha. Yord and his new Padawan, Tasi Lowa, located Osha on the starship *Fallon*, where she was working. They questioned Osha, who knew nothing about the murder. Later, a witness to the crime arrived and identified Osha as the assailant, at which point Yord placed her under arrest and sent her to Coruscant aboard the Prison ship *Palwick*. Osha did not resist, still confident that the Jedi would treat her fairly. For this reason, she did not join her fellow prisoners when they staged a mutiny, bringing the ship out of hyperspace in an asteroid field near Carlac before fleeing in an escape pod. Osha managed to open her cell with Pip's help, but the ship was already crippled by strikes with asteroids. She could do nothing more than strap in as it went down and crashed on Carlac's frozen surface.[1]
 
Unconscious among the wreckage, Osha experienced a vision of Mae as a little girl on Brendok. The vision convinced her not only that her twin sister was alive, but also that she had killed Indara and was determined to kill others.[1] Meanwhile on Coruscant, Sol learned about Osha's arrest, the mutiny, and the crash. He determined to go find her, believing that she was still his responsibility. He traveled to Carlac with his new Padawan, Jecki Lon, and Yord. Osha at first fled when she saw the pursuing Jedi, and even when she recognized Sol, she nearly fell off a cliff trying to keep away from him. Sol stopped her fall with the Force for a second time; Osha then told him that Mae was alive.[1]
 
The Jedi identified Qimir as Mae's likely supplier and accomplice. Following a suggestion from Jecki Lon, Osha went to him wearing a cloak to impersonate Mae. The attempt at going undercover failed: Qimir saw through the ruse right away, before she could get any useful information. Sol, Yord, and Jacki, listening in, then appeared in force. Qimir quickly confessed that he had supplied the poison but admitted to no further relationship with Mae.[7]
 
Sol now planned to confront Mae that night. Osha wanted to join him, saying that she wanted justice for her sister. Sol warned her not to interfere: what she called justice was nothing more than a desire for revenge. Pip helped Osha tap into the comms of the Jedi as Sol and Mae faced each other. In this way, Osha learned that just as she had believed Mae to have died the fire on Brendok, Mae also believed that Osha had died. As Mae fled, Osha ran to find her. The two sisters saw each other for the first time in sixteen years; Osha took two shots with a stun blaster, missing both times before Mae sped away in a stolen landspeeder.[7]
 
Osha traveled with the team to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, her home for ten years. Her name was now cleared of the murders, and she prepared to return to her normal life. She found Jecki at training and looked on as the familiar exercise concluded. When Jecki finished, Osha approached her to say goodbye and thank her for her help. Jecki gently invited Osha to stay until Mae could be apprehended, but Osha felt that she could not. She planned to leave without telling Master Sol.[10]
 
Sol found Osha as she was about to board a transport with Pip. He told her that as Mae's sister, she could help them stop her without using violence. Sol believed there was still good in her and that she loved her family, and thus Osha could convince her to stop her violent quest. Sol asked Osha to accompany him on his new mission, though as a civilian and not a Jedi. Sol's team was going to Khofar in an attempt to find Master Kelnacca before Mae could make him her next victim. Osha accepted, traveling with the Jedi
