My life goals, in this case, are just a sum of that: different experiences I have had with friends and teachers, all of them helping me understand what it means to live and experience different things in life. My life goals are not centered around one outcome but across many different outcomes that I know will benefit me in many ways later.
 
For the past 21 years, I have been immersed in the realm of Christian Education. During 16 of those years, I held the position of Head of School at three distinct Christian institutions in South Africa. In 2017, I was honored to assume the role of Regional Director for ACSI, with its base in Johannesburg. This position entrusted me with the responsibility of providing service and support to 160 schools and school leaders in the Southern African region, which includes Zimbabwe, Eswatini, Zambia, and Malawi. This opportunity was a humbling experience as it allowed me to contribute towards the realization of authentic Christian Education within schools. Following six fruitful years with ACSI, a lifelong dream of contributing to Christian Education globally materialized, leading me to SPH Lippo Cikarang.
 
The IB Diploma Programme (IB DP) is more than just academics. This rigorous program shapes young people who are ready for the challenges and expectations of the very best universities around the world.
 
Each year, 95% of our graduates pursue tertiary studies at top-tier universities outside Indonesia. Since growth in faith is central in everything we do, we integrate a good mix of faith lessons with quality education.
 
The DP curriculum consists of six (6) subject groups, namely language and literature, language acquisition, individuals and societies, sciences, math, and the arts. Aside from completing subject examinations and undergoing internal and external assessments, students must accomplish three core elements of the curriculum.
 
The IBDP aligns with our core values and we see the IB curriculum as the best pathway to prepare our children for higher education whether in Indonesia or other countries. It is designed to equip students with basic academic skills needed for university study, further education, and their chosen profession. Moreover, the program supports the development of values and life skills needed to live a fulfilled and purposeful life.
 
The International Baccalaureate program aligns with our core values and we see the IB curriculum as the best pathway to prepare our children for higher education whether in Indonesia or other countries.
 
The International Baccalaureate (IB) education focuses on students ages 3 to 19 through unique learning styles, strengths and challenges. The IB puts emphasis on each student as a whole person. Thus, IB programs address not only cognitive development but social, emotional and physical well-being.

**IB MYP (Middle Years Programme)**
Grades 7-10

It follows naturally from the Primary Years Programme and serves as excellent preparation for the rigors of studies in the IB Diploma Programme. The program provides students discipline, skills and challenging standards, along with creativity and flexibility.
 
Infused with Christ-centred and bible-based perspectives to meet our student needs, the SPH Cambridge curriculum is flexible, challenging, inspiring and culturally sensitive but international in approach.
