As Schiphol, we believe cooperation to be very important. We and our aviation industry partners are facing several challenges. How can we continue to ensure safety in an increasingly crowded airspace? How do we allocate our scarce resources as effectively as possible when there are increasing demands on operations? These are challenges that can only be addressed integrally with all airport partners. By working with our partners as one ecosystem, we can proactively solve the challenges that lie ahead. This is what led to the intention to get all major airports in Europe, including Schiphol, working according to the Total Airport Management concept.

By working with partners, we are able to prepare, plan and manage together. This allows us to look at the whole process instead of just separate parts, which means we have better insight into what lies ahead in the entire airport ecosystem. This is called Total Airport Management. This integral method of management ensures that we can better manage capacity together with our partners. Performance improvement becomes visible chain-wide in better On Time Performance (OTP), better capacity utilisation and effective information sharing between chain parties and the passenger.
 
One building block on the way to Total Airport Management (TAM) is the creation of the APOC. The APOC stands for the Airport Operations Centre. The APOC was set up in 2019 as the central location within Schiphol to facilitate cooperation between different parties at the airport to prepare operations on a daily basis. Every day, these parties work together to make airport operations more predictable, flexible and efficient, and to reduce recovery time after disruptions. This contributes to the performance and passenger experience at the airport. The APOC seeks to achieve these goals by encouraging a different way of thinking, collaborating and acting. The APOC focuses on overseeing separate processes at the airport (such as the passenger, security, baggage and aircraft processes) in order to prepare them properly. This is done by identifying and solving data-driven capacity issues.

The biggest challenge is that there are many external parties working at Schiphol, all of whom have an impact on operations. These include the various airlines, security companies, baggage handlers and the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee. For a smooth operation, an integrated plan must be drawn up daily with all these chain partners. A plan in which we look at what we are facing in the operation and what the joint outlook is. We record this in the Airport Operations Plan (AOP) and share it with all our partners.
 
The Total airport management (TAM) project (PJ04) was a SESAR 2020 research project that focused on a range of different airport complexity levels, developing scalable and cost-effective solutions, optimising both the local benefits and the benefits for the European network. Societal concerns were be addressed by ensuring that environmental mitigation measures and impact are included in the airport performance trade-off.
 
The integration of airports into the air traffic management (ATM) network was addressed through timely information sharing between the Network Operations Plan and the individual local airport Operation Plans.
 
An additional area for development concerns 'what-if' decision support tools, business intelligence predictive tools and performance dashboards. The ability to analyse the trade-off among numerous performance indicators will become an integral part of the collaborative decision-making process.
 
This project favoured the evolution toward a 'performance-driven' airport through holistic monitoring of demand and capacity. Decision making will be based on more reliable information with enhanced decision impact assessment. As a result, there should be an improvement in the predictability, flexibility and efficiency of airport operations as well as increased resilience through shorter recovery to normal operations.
 
As clients of airport services, airlines benefit from enhanced operational efficiency. For passengers, benefits are tangible. The available information is of high quality and the more efficient use of airport resources lead to enhanced service quality.
 
Optimising the collaborative performance management process via the TAM approach is most beneficial at complex, busy hub airports, where measures such as improved communication between the airport and the Network Manager can bring both local and network benefits.
 
However, the project is not only about the major hub airports. In fact, the TAM concept was designed also to take into account the specific needs of smaller or regional airports, by ensuring scalability as a function of traffic and the potential network impact. Such 'regional' airports are often key drivers of the local economy, and it is important that there is not a 'one size fits all' approach. We have to ensure that only those elements which bring the most benefit at an affordable level are implemented locally.
 
The project performed a number of different concept development activities with increasing levels of maturity over time, and at each stage provided evidence of the performance benefits to be expected as well as more transverse elements covering safety, security and associated costs and benefits. The aim is to ensure that the final operational concept delivered by the project is safe and cost-effective and provides performance benefits.
 
Elements of the other TAM Solutions relating to regional airport connectivity (Solution 28.2) and environmental performance monitoring (solution 29.3) are now being further developed within the SESAR3 Industrial Research Programme and its associated demonstration activities.
 
Airport Operations Management in SESAR1 promoted enhanced situational awareness via the Airport Operations Plan (AOP), whilst reinforcing the collaborative decision-making process through the Airport Operations Centre (APOC).
 
Validation activities stressed the need to further develop the performance monitoring and management services promoting the evolution from a reactive ("firefighting") approach toward one of pro-active collaborative decision making.
