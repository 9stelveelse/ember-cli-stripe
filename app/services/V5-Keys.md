When using Redis Cluster, the search is optimized for patterns that imply a single slot.If a pattern can only match keys of one slot,Redis only iterates over keys in that slot, rather than the whole database,when searching for keys matching the pattern.For example, with the pattern ah\*llo, Redis would only try to match it with the keys in slot 15495, which hash tag a implies.To use pattern with hash tag, see Hash tags in the Cluster specification for more information.

The Keys class contains constants for processing keyboard input. The members of the Keys enumeration consist of a key code and a set of modifiers combined into a single integer value. In the Win32 application programming interface (API) a key value has two halves, with the high-order bits containing the key code (which is the same as a Windows virtual key code), and the low-order bits representing key modifiers such as the SHIFT, CONTROL, and ALT keys.
 
For finer control, use the Windows API functions GetKeyState, GetAsyncKeyState, or GetKeyboardState defined in user32.dll, to do this. For more information about calling native functions, see Consuming Unmanaged DLL Functions.
 
The following table shows the key code values represented by two enumerated values, representing both the general original equipment manufacturer (OEM) keys and the more specific U.S.-keyboard associations.
 
For the .NET Framework 2.0, a member IMEAccept was added that supersedes the previous entry, IMEAceept, which was spelled incorrectly. The older version has been retained for backward compatibility, but it may be deleted in future versions of the .NET Framework
 
Keys is an extension to make entering and styling keyboard key presses easier. Syntactically, Keys is built around the + symbol. A key or combination of key presses is surrounded by ++ with each key press separated with a single +.
 
You might have noticed that in this page many keys show special Unicode symbols before (and sometimes after) a key's text. The Keys extension only provides ASCII labels out of the box. Any special Unicode characters that are seen in this document are provided by using additional CSS.
 
You can use CSS styling. The elements are created with classes that are derived from the main key code name (not the aliases) so that you can target them to provide special styling. Check out Formatting for more info.
 
Notice the wrapper span has the class keys applied to it. This is so you can target it or the elements under it with CSS. Each recognized key has its own special key class assigned to it in the form key-. These individual key classes are great if you want to show a special modifier key symbol before the key text (which is done in this documentation).
 
If you would like to generate a key which isn't in the key index, you can extend the key map via a special option. But if you don't need a key with a special class generated, or you need a way to quickly enter a one time, arbitrary key, you can just insert it directly, instead of specifying the key's name, by quoting the content displayed instead of a key name. You can also enter HTML entities if desired.
 
By default, Keys provides a key-map index for English US keyboards. The key-map index is a dictionary that provides all the supported key names along with their corresponding display text. There is also a separate alias dictionary which maps some aliases to entries in the key-map index.
 
If you want to add additional keys, or override text of existing keys, you can feed in your keys via the key\_map option. The key\_map parameter takes a simple dictionary with key names that are represented by lowercase alphanumeric characters and hyphens (-). The values of the dictionary represent the the text that is displayed for the key in the HTML output.
 
So if you wanted to add a custom key, you could do this: "custom": "Custom Key". If you wanted to override the output of the option key and change it from Option to Opt, you could do this: "option": "Opt".
 
You can access and write data in repositories on GitHub.com using SSH (Secure Shell Protocol). When you connect via SSH, you authenticate using a private key file on your local machine. For more information, see "About SSH."
 
When you generate an SSH key, you can add a passphrase to further secure the key. Whenever you use the key, you must enter the passphrase. If your key has a passphrase and you don't want to enter the passphrase every time you use the key, you can add your key to the SSH agent. The SSH agent manages your SSH keys and remembers your passphrase.
 
If you don't already have an SSH key, you must generate a new SSH key to use for authentication. If you're unsure whether you already have an SSH key, you can check for existing keys. For more information, see "Checking for existing SSH keys."
 
If you want to use a hardware security key to authenticate to GitHub, you must generate a new SSH key for your hardware security key. You must connect your hardware security key to your computer when you authenticate with the key pair. For more information, see the OpenSSH 8.2 release notes.
 
RSA keys (ssh-rsa) with a valid\_after before November 2, 2021 may continue to use any signature algorithm. RSA keys generated after that date must use a SHA-2 signature algorithm. Some older clients may need to be upgraded in order to use SHA-2 signatures.
 
When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key", you can press **Enter** to accept the default file location. Please note that if you created SSH keys previously, ssh-keygen may ask you to rewrite another key, in which case we recommend creating a custom-named SSH key. To do so, type the default file location and replace id\_ALGORITHM with your custom key name.
 
Before adding a new SSH key to the ssh-agent to manage your keys, you should have checked for existing SSH keys and generated a new SSH key. When adding your SSH key to the agent, use the default macOS ssh-add command, and not an application installed by macports, homebrew, or some other external source.
 
Depending on your environment, you may need to use a different command. For example, you may need to use root access by running sudo -s -H before starting the ssh-agent, or you may need to use exec ssh-agent bash or exec ssh-agent zsh to run the ssh-agent.
 
Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent and store your passphrase in the keychain. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace id\_ed25519 in the command with the name of your private key file.
 
**Note:** The --apple-use-keychain option stores the passphrase in your keychain for you when you add an SSH key to the ssh-agent. If you chose not to add a passphrase to your key, run the command without the --apple-use-keychain option.
 
The --apple-use-keychain option is in Apple's standard version of ssh-add. In macOS versions prior to Monterey (12.0), the --apple-use-keychain and --apple-load-keychain flags used the syntax -K and -A, respectively.
 
In a terminal window without elevated permissions, add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent.If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace id\_ed25519 in the command with the name of your private key file.
 
**Note:** If the command fails and you receive the error invalid format or feature not supported, you may be using a hardware security key that does not support the Ed25519 algorithm. Enter the following command instead.
 
As a best practice, use temporary security credentials (such as IAM roles) instead of creating long-term credentials like access keys. Before creating access keys, review the alternatives to long-term access keys.
 
Access keys are long-term credentials for an IAM user or the AWS account root user. You can use access keys to sign programmatic requests to the AWS CLI or AWS API (directly or using the AWS SDK). For more information, see Signing AWS API requests.
 
Access keys consist of two parts: an access key ID (for example, AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE) and a secret access key (for example, wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY). You must use both the access key ID and secret access key together to authenticate your requests.
 
When you create an access key pair, save the access key ID
