Berlin-based independent music label Pelagic Records commemorates the work of electronic music pioneer **LUSTMORD** by releasing a boxset titled The Other, based around his tenth studio album [ O T H E R ], originally released in 2008 and to date the only LUSTMORD album with guitars on it, performed by Adam Jones (TOOL), King Buzzo (THE MELVINS) and Aaron Turner (ISIS).
 
Michelin-starred Adam Handling MBE has created a work of art with this boxset of three books that showcase his restaurants, reflect his commitment to sustainability and embody the best of his Michelin-starred cooking. Complete with hand-drawn illustrations, this limited edition food, waste and cocktail box set is a cut above the rest.

His waste book demonstrates his passion for sustainability and looks at the ways we can all utilise commonly wasted ingredients and transform them into spectacular dishes, illustrating that there should simply be no such thing as food waste. Featuring a foraging guide of the British Isles, great recipes, smart techniques and a commitment to be part of a positive change, it leads from the front in the fight to protect the environment.
