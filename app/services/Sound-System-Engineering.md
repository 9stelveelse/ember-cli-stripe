Pat Brown is the president of Synergetic Audio Concepts, Inc., and of Electro-acoustic Testing Company, Inc., both of Greenville, Indiana. He teaches audio engineering seminars worldwide, and develops web-based audio training programs. His background as a musician, sound contractor, and electronics technician and consultant has forged his practical approach to solving audio and acoustic problems.
 
Although live sound mix engineers are highly lauded for their ability to control and improve the live music experience, even the best would be powerless without a live sound systems engineer. Part acoustician, part electrician, and all problem-solver, live sound systems engineers are leaders in touring sound crews, where they're responsible for designing rigging and power configurations for sound equipment, optimizing safety and efficiency in the setup, creatively solving acoustic problems, and overseeing load-in and breakdown.
 
While live sound systems engineers have a wide range of discrete responsibilities, all of their job duties come back to a core goal: to create an effective, safe, balanced, and efficient sound system, in the process providing mix engineers with the tools they need to create excellent sound.
 
As load-in commences, the systems engineer oversees a team that enacts the rigging design, which is based on the demands of the space and a desired sonic coverage. Once everything is rigged, the systems engineer works with electricians to ensure that power is distributed safely and efficiently to each piece of equipment. Then the systems engineer commences arguably the most important task: dealing with acoustic problems within the space.
 
Using sound-measuring software to get a sense of pressure levels throughout the space, systems engineers ensure that the audio system will be able to smoothly distribute high, mid, and low frequencies. They also determine and remove problematic resonant frequencies, address troublesome sound reflections (e.g. from a large TV screen hanging from the ceiling of an arena), and strategically position delayed loudspeakers.

Once these tasks are completed, the sound systems engineer is on call for the duration of the show, solving any sound problems that arise. At the end of the show, the systems engineer oversees breakdown and storage of all the sound equipment.
 
These days, employers usually expect sound systems engineers to have degrees in acoustics, sound engineering, or electrical engineering. However, far more essential is touring experience, whether as a roadie, rigger, or sound system tech. In fact, participating in sound load-in and load-out throughout a tour can teach many of the essentials of the trade.
 
For the rest, apprenticing with or assisting a working sound systems engineer is the way to go. Experienced and successful systems engineers might build the sound systems for prestigious live events and festivals, or become industry staples and form their own event/touring sound systems companies. They might also choose to settle down, and design and maintain sound systems for a number of local clubs, concert halls, and theaters.
 
While some live music venues employ in-house sound engineers, the vast majority of live sound systems engineers are independent contractors hired by artists to travel with them on tour, and occasionally by festivals. Because jobs are largely filled via word of mouth, building strong industry relationships and a reputation for consistent work is essential to finding work. Live sound systems engineers with the right skill set might find additional work as live sound mix engineers, studio mixing engineers, lighting techs, or acoustical consultants.
 
Sound systems engineers are organized, detail-oriented, and adaptable. Every show is different, and systems engineers must be thoroughly prepared for acoustical interferences, equipment that doesn't perform as expected, and more. Additionally, it's important that sound systems engineers are good team players and are able to perform their duties to a high level of rigor without the expectation of public recognition. As leaders, they must be capable of delegating tasks to the rest of the touring team: riggers, electricians, roadies, and apprenticing sound techs.
 
Long considered the only book an audio engineer needs on their shelf, Sound System Engineering provides an accurate, complete and concise tool for all those involved in sound system engineering. 

Fully updated on the design, implementation and testing of sound reinforcement systems this great reference is a necessary addition to any audio engineering library.

Packed with revised material, numerous illustrations and useful appendices, this is a concentrated capsule of knowledge and industry standard that runs the complete range of sound system design from the simplest all-analog paging systems to the largest multipurpose digital systems.

A sound engineer, sometimes referred to as an audio engineer, is a professional trained in the mechanics of recording, mixing, and reproducing sound. Working solely with the technical aspects of music, sound engineers manipulate the different aspects of sound as a part of the overall commercial production process.
 
If you have ever seen an amazing concert in the heart of Baltimore, attended a large community event, or have watched a film in the theater, you can attribute the wonderful sound you heard to a talented sound engineer.
 
Because of this, there are many sub-disciplines to sound engineering that all contribute to bringing audiences high-quality sound. And chances are the sound engineers bringing music to the Baltimore community attended a high-level audio-engineering school.
 
You often find these engineers mixing music for parties but you can also find them at corporate meetings, live concerts, sporting events, or live television shows. Though quite popular in the audio engineering industry, it is important to note that the FOH position plays a relatively small part in creating high-quality sound.
 
Monitor sound engineers, also known as foldback engineers, utilize a stage monitoring system to communicate with performers as a production plays out in real-time. Performers usually receive personalized feeds via stage floor or in-ear monitors which open the lines of communication between sound engineer and performer. Each performer has the ability to communicate with the monitor sound engineer independent from what the audience hears so that the performance remains seamless.
 
Not to be confused with the field of system engineering (which focuses on how to design and manage complex engineering systems over their life cycles), a systems engineer is responsible for the design and setup of PA systems.
 
Since modern PA systems are very complex, there is a lot of technical knowledge required to perform the job well. In addition, systems engineers usually manage the FOH and monitor sound engineers. This is a lot of responsibility and requires the completion of audio engineering courses to fully understand the position.
 
One such bill, the CALM Act, was created by the FCC to lay out specific regulations regarding television volumes. These regulations apply to all states, Maryland included. Because of this, those seeking a career as a studio sound engineer should invest in audio engineering classes to learn all of the techniques of post-production sound processing.
