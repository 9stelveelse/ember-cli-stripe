In its most general sense, twilight is the period of time before sunrise and after sunset, in which the atmosphere is partially illuminated by the sun, being neither totally dark or completely lit. However there are three categories of twilight that are defined by how far the sun is below the horizon.
 
Experience the sights and sounds of the Zoo at twilight! After dinner at home, observe interesting animal behavior while taking a tour of the Zoo in a small group led by your personal guide. (Please note that not all animals are out at night.) Tours start promptly at 6:30 p.m. and will occur rain or shine. Meet at the front of the zoo.

I held out for so long. I got downright uppity about it. And then I heard Robert Pattinson would be in the movie, and my resolve weakened ("Cedric Diggory's gonna be a vampire?!"). Then the trailer came out, and I knew it was time to crumble. Besides--won't it be easier to deal with all the fandom squee if I'm already assimilated?
 
I enjoyed the first book--and hated the second--more than I expected. The third one just made me scream. Let's not even get started on the fourth one. And yet I am hopelessly addicted to them, and waiting for Midnight Sun as if it were Christmas.
 
Emo teenage girl moves to new town, meets mysterious boy, realizes he's a sparkling vampire; Greatest Love of All Time Omg ensues. In later books, a love triangle forms with the addition of a werewolf. Babies are of paramount importance; going to college is not. Some readers rank the series up there with Pride and Prejudice and the works of Shakespeare; some readers... beg to differ. Severely.

Edward Cullen's favorite color, certainly in terms of clothing. I can respect that Stephenie Meyer (as I read her say somewhere) wanted to go in the opposite direction from the clichd gothy-dark fashions vampires usually appear in. It's just... also... kind of hilarious.
 
I think I mentioned "exploding werewolves" in one of the recaps, and then actually started using the word "fursplode" for the Breaking Dawn commentary ("...and apparently they go on Quileuting happily until vampires settle in the area, at which point the current generation of young people will FURSPLODE! into werewolves"). Here's why:
 
A tag I instituted after getting sockpuppet complaints about Twilight snark. Because, you know, I never snark on anything else, ever, and I certainly haven't been paid to do it. Basically, an entry with this tag means that I fully expect bitching:
 
The best game ever, and how I was actually sucked into reading the books myself. What happens is, someone unfamiliar with Twilight happens to hear some detail ("Wait... they sparkle?" ; "Vampire baseball?" ), and someone who has read the books has the pleasure of giving them the full picture. Example:
 
It's kind of a love-at-first-sight thing for werewolves--once they see their soulmate for the first time, that person becomes "the center of their universe" absolutely. It's controversial in the books, besides the obvious reason (the person imprinted on gets no choice at all in the matter, and it is explained that "it's hard to resist that kind of love and devotion," so--hope you like being stuck with some random werewolf guy!), because teenage Quil imprints on a two-year-old, and Jacob... well. But here's how Jacob hand-waves that bit of creepiness:
 
I pretty much made up this word just now to describe the kind of people (i.e., me) who read these books for the sole purpose of snarking on them and yet cannot stop oh God please send help. Levels of affection for the subject matter may vary; macros and icons are often involved. Twatlighters (see below) are a good example of lolfans.
 
The favored recreational activity of Twilighters, both pro- and-anti-fans. Didn't like Breaking Dawn? Think people who didn't like Breaking Dawn are omgsomeen? Want Stephenie Meyer to finish Midnight Sun? You, my friend, need to start a petition.
 
Actor Robert Pattinson, who plays Edward Cullen in the movie(s) (and also played Harry Potter's rival Cedric Diggory, btw). Harry Potter has Radcakes; Twilight has RPattz, who in turn lives in apparent (but polite) fear of the fangirls, and with good reason. (I don't know for sure, but I think the nickname comes from ONTD/Twatlight.) As I once remarked elsewhere, re: Comic-Con (see below),
 
One of my favorite things ever is when friends call me up after finally getting around to Netflixing the movie and say, "Okay, I thought 'sparkling' was a fandom joke. I DIDN'T REALIZE IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED."
 
It originates from a Donnie Darko quote ("Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion," which is a dance team). and I'm sure I'm not the only one who's ever come up with it. I use the phrase "Sparkle Motion" to mean "general Twilight hilarity, particularly involving insane fans." An entry tagged "twilight" has Twilight-related links or discussion; an entry also tagged "sparkle motion" means that there's some ridiculousness (or sparkly macros, or lolarious magazine covers, or wintastic interviews) involved--or, as in the case of the Breaking Dawn commentary, actual sparkling--that will delight your soul.
 
Rhymes with "diehards," as in "diehard fans," and means much the same thing. I seem to recall some Twilighters taking offense to the nickname, though, in a "We're Trekkers, not Trekkies!" kind of way.
 
It's a two-hour conversation in which Rinna, Lady Chi and I discuss Harry Potter, Twilight, the Lexicon case, fandom, religion, sex, feminism, politics, racism, aging, depression, kittens, grammar, education, constructive criticism, community theater, and, my God, SHIPPING PREFERENCES. And also, Alan Rickman. Bonus feature: my Emmett Cullen impression.
 
My first appearance on the show, in which I start trying to explain Twilight to the gang. I get a lot of stunned silence in return. I've also been on to discuss Harry Potter and Watchmen, but I'm the go-to guest any time a Twilight movie comes out.
 
A discussion of the Eclipse movie that takes a half-hour detour into The Most Epic Game of Horrify the Twilight Noob Ever Recorded. It's awesome. If you have ever wanted to hear someone describe what happens in Breaking Dawn to someone who has no idea what happens, or you have someone you'd like to horrify yourself, this is the show for you. Also, it turns out that mine is an evil laugh.
 
I don't know how I got to be a Twilight "expert," exactly, but... it happened. Maybe because I can explain things without buying into them. I have, in fact, given quotes to three or four reporters over the phone (and explained the entire series plot to a couple of them). I also do birthdays and bar mitzvahs. A sampling:
 
Can you see the picture of Bella in the window? The Petite Jolie is actually a hair salon located at 251 South 1st Street. the Columbia County Courthouse is right across the street, you can see it behind Bella as she sits in the window seat.
 
There was never a filming in Washington Forks Washington was not a filming area for any part of the twilight. It is 2017 and I just went on my own pilgrimage with my husband to all of the filming scenes. We just stayed in Forks Washington for a week. Some people in Forks are manipulating people to believe sites were in films that were never there
