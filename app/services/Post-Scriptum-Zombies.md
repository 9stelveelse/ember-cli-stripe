Any how , Khaine much appreciate your time making the mods , vids and responses your legendary mate.
 
I'm the other way around. I have a dual boot on my dev machine and I actually have LESS FPS on Linux than I do on windows (for 7DTD).

So I only use it for testing.

No ghosting or screen tearing on windows either, but then I have 100hz panel in the laptop (actually 60hz but messed with the display settings to set 100hz and it's stable). Only time i've ever had screen tearing or ghosting on ANY app on windows was running FPS higher than the refresh rate of the monitor.

But that's what gsync/freesync is for.

So are you using the Vulkan or GLcore cause im using Vulkan its that, that's getting me those high frames. On GLcore its about the same as windows and for some reason Vulkan doesn't work with windows and GLcore has a bunch of static racing across the ground textures , so im using DX11 , im on a 6 core ryzen 3600 with 64 gig RAM and a MSI RX5700 with 8 gigs , and DX11 Can't touch Vulkan . so my point is if you haven't tried the (not fully supported) Vulkan Render try it just don't use it to generate a map thats where it all falls apart but once a map is generated it runs better on Vulkan , im excited to see Vulkan get more wide spread support it work great with Linux . BTW everything is working tip top i followed your instruction to a Tee and i am glad to report the file pathing is exactly the same so you instruction are good for both windows and Linux users . couldn't help but giggle at the sigh of the 96 slot BP lol .
 One last question if im running a coop game i assume any one who join will need to down load the modlets ? or is only applied to my player?
 
That'll be why.

You're on AMD. I'm on nVidia. nVidia sucks for linux.

And since they're XML modlets, no-one needs them if they join you. The game sends the patched XML to anyone joining.
 
Hi, i'm fairly new to 7d2d and modding in general. I tried installing the HP bar mod today and no matter what i did i couldn't get it to work. I know that the mod manages to load up because there is a constant translucent bar at the top of the middle of the screen, exactly as it is in your video. However, when i get close to zombies or start attacking them it just stays like that. There is no text and nor does it change red.
 
it Doesnt?????? hooooly crap! I would be SO happy if so! I made another new save last night... a 100% legit vanilla experience in latest experimental. Watched the achievements unlock for once. But My dear gosh the last 2 hrs of my playtime was struggling with backpack size lol. TYVM!

Huh I installed 3 of them, 96 backpack, stash icons, and zomb/animal spawning and something seems to have broke the game. After launching it just hangs on the title screen. 

Edit2: Alright I watched the vid. I was under the impression these were called 'modlets' I guess because they were just/// 'XML edits' as OP specified. Which, in essence they are but they still require a folder called 'mods' lol. I was comparing the specified XMLs the game showed as erroneous lol uh wtf obviously this isnt right.
 
Okay, but, so... youre SURE these don't disable steam achievements now? I mean I restarted like 6x in the last 2 days just trying to make stuff work. Lots of stuff says 'ANY MODS WHATSOEVER, ANYTING THAT ISNT VANILLA WILL DISABLE ACHIEVEMENTS'. Im sorry to doubt you, but please understand I can only start over so many times before going crazy

Backpack buttons modlet no longer required as of b177.

Other modlets seem ok.

Uploaded a new modlet that adds the ability to "lock" the backpack slots (like you could in my backpack buttons modlet) AND vehicle slots. It also seems to stop locked slots being "sorted" when you click the sort button.

 -modlets-a19/-/archive/master/khaines-modlets-a19-master.zip?path=KHA19-LockableInvSlots

EDIT: Just noticed the lock thingy has some overlap with the "clear inventory" button when you have the creative menu open. I'll move it later. It's good enough for the general player right now.
 
Logged on this morning and saw the new update screwed up the backpack button modlet since they finally added them to the game. Thank you so much for releasing a update for the lockable slots so fast! Keep up the good work!
 
Wow TFP finally added the backpack buttons to the base game, now if they would just add the ability to lock stuff so I don't have to remember what the hell I was carrying when I dump into the storage boxes. Looks like I'll be using your modlet until they get to work on that.
 
Ok.

Updated Backpack Buttons V1. It still uses the new code, AND has the lockable slots included. However, I removed the backpack icon on the left, moved all the buttons to the left, moved the "Inventory" text to the middle of the bar and put back my custom icons.

Lockable slots updated to move the box + arrows to the left of the sort button so it doesn't overlap the "clear inventory" button.

Backpack Buttons V1 also had a folder rename so it loads FIRST, which means backpack modlets should then work with it.

If folks like that layout, I can update the V2 to work the same way.
 
Village people. Pffff. Village people. Quelle nerie, ce nom. Pourtant, c'tait bien, Village people. Ca a eu pay. Mais c'est dpass. Samedi prochain, chiche, j'enlve le haut de cette chronique et je la rebaptise Plante People. Ou United colors of people. Ou un truc, genre People de tous les pays. Genre.
 
D'abord un tapis rouge film exactement comme au Festival de Cannes. Arrive un Nicolas habill en Dior Homme - comme la majorit des stars masculines de Cannes (pour l'pineuse question de ses pompes glands, prire de lire le post-scriptum). Et puis, une famille Sarkozy qui dbarque, sape mais relax, comme dboulent, Cannes, les vedettes d'une superproduction amricaine. Et puis, toute cette Sarko-family, statufie dans la posture d'une dynastie lue dmocratiquement faon Kennedy, et qui salue longuement le mur des photographes - comme Cannes. Une Ccilia, moins zombie sous Prozac que d'habitude, en robe de satin duchesse ivoire signe Prada - la marque des actrices intellos-cool, Cannes. Sans oublier des Sarko-enfants qui ressemblent aux fils de Caroline de Monaco - on reste tout prs de Cannes.
 
Dj, quelques jours plus tt, l'escapade de Sarko sur son yacht n'avait rien de la retraite d'un chef d'Etat. Mais tout de l'vasion d'un people qui se cherche la fois un refuge (la mer, l'endroit le plus difficile d'accs pour les paparazzi) et une scne starifiante pour Paris-Match (la silhouette du people qui se dcoupe sur le luxueux bateau blanc et sous le bal valorisant des hlicos).
 
La voil, la force mdiatique de S(t)arkozy: avoir dtourn les codes spectaculaires de la presse people pour en faire une forme d'piphanie politique. A cet gard, ceux qui ont hurl que la fugue de Sarko sur son yacht et ses accointances avec Bollor taient un camouflet pour l'opinion franaise n'ont pas compris que la clbrit et le fric dpens par brasses n'taient plus un truc honteux et rpressible, mais le mode d'apparition des people et par l mme quelque chose d'admir, d'adul, d'ador. Bienvenue dans le XXIe sicle et la VIe Rpublique, celle du people ber alles. People ber alles. Un joli titre pour une chronique, ja?
 
PS. Jeudi, pour son intronisation, le nouveau prsident franais portait des chaussures ornes de deux pompons de cuir - qu'on appelle officiellement pampilles ou glands. Sarko, pompes glands, beaucoup ont rican de voir ainsi le roi des Franais dambuler chauss de souliers voquant le rastaquoure enrichi. Certes, certes. Mais c'est ignorer, aussi, que les pompes glands taient les prfres de George Brummel (1778-1840), le pre incontest du bon got masculin.
