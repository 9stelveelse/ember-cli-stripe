Also, making your own first unity3d game - A very simple one like pong - NOT AN MMORPG is the ultimate teacher. Make games - start simple, and then make more and more complicated/better ones. The good courses force you to do just that.
 
Maybe try this course Dead Earth Game Development - Course Description for fraction of the price. Think first heard about it here and they have extended the Christmas sale unti end of January so currently half price. Had favourable reviews. I did start watching the first part that is freely available and liked the approach.
 
Unity courses offered through Coursera equip learners with knowledge in programming games with C#; bringing games to market; creating 2D arcade games; implementing features such as a complex camera system into your game; and more.
 
Lessons on Unity are taught by instructors from major tech names and universities, including University of Colorado, Michigan State University, University of London, Unity itself, and other organizations. Learners can enjoy exploring Unity with instructors specializing in Computing, Game Design, Media, Engineering and Applied Science, and other disciplines. Course content on Unity is delivered via video lectures, hands-on projects, readings, quizzes, and other types of assignments.
 
People who are either artistic or love coding or both are often well suited for roles in Unity. If you enjoy gaming as a hobby, a role in Unity would likely be very interesting to you. People best suited for roles in Unity are skilled at software development, and they also work well on a team, are able to communicate one-on-one with senior leadership as well as colleagues, and are good at problem-solving under pressure. People who succeed in roles involving Unity are often creative and inquisitive and have good time management skills.
 
After learning the essentials of Unity, a common career path is to become a junior programmer so you can learn the coding skills needed to create more projects. People may then advance to game development and app creation or go into a specialized field such as a graphics designer, AR/VR programmer, or gameplay designer. Those who want to become more marketable in game development usually seek Unity Programmer certification. You may choose to advance your career as a Unity 3D rendering engineer or technical artist. Senior positions to aspire to include senior Unity optimization engineer, senior Unity programmer, or senior Unity game programmer.
 
Topics that you can study that are related to Unity include gaming design, illustration, coding, and virtual reality. You might study art and physics as well. App development is related to Unity, as are programming languages like C# and full-stack development. Unity has expanded beyond the gaming industry, so additional related topics include film, architecture, engineering, automotive, and construction.

Although the course is set in 2D a lot of the information in there contains game mechanics using triggers and programming patterns that also relate to using 3D.
An example would be oscillating lights which is just a matter of changing the direction or adding a second dimension so that you get side to side and up and down motion at the same time creating a 3D disco effect.
If you havent done a lot of work in lighting and sound in 3D yet then this would be a good toolset to add to your belt.
 
I have completed this course, It does go into global volumes for post processing, and stuff like Impulse so that translates. To me, the real shine in the course was the real world use of design patterns like observer pattern. It was very helpful for me to understand how to get my code from prototype quality to production quality. i have finished a handful of courses since and this is still my favorite.
 
With the removal of the Making the Switch From Unity To Unreal course, I am looking for recommendations on good courses for learning about switching from Unity to Unreal 5. Bonus points if the course is Virtual Reality leaning, but a good course on the proper use of Unreal through a Unity lens would be great. A course that walks through porting a project from Unity to Unreal 5 would also be great.
 
Unity development involves creating video games and other interactive experiences using the Unity game engine, but to become a Unity developer, you'll need a strong foundation in C#, as well as an understanding of game design principles and 3D modeling.
