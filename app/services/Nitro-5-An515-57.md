If anyone still has the same problem, here's my solution. I had the same exact problem and have been struggling with it for days and no solution on any forum have fixed it for me.
Today I have tried to uninstall all the vga drivers once again manually and noticed that whatever I do they kept coming back even with the internet off. Windows just kept installing them somehow and I had to prevent it from doing that.
Here's what I've done:
1. Download GPU drivers from official Acer site: -pl/support?search=Nitro%20AN515-57&filter=global\_download&suggest=an515-57;1 - VGA Driver ('your gpu model')
2. Turn off your internet connection
3. In Windows go to Settings > System > About/Info > System protection > Hardware > Device install settings; here just click the 'No' option- this prevents Windows from installing any driver updates by itself
4. Open Device manager and uninstall your gpu drivers
5. Restart your system
6. Install your designated GPU drivers ( Advanced install > Clean install )

This method finally worked for me and now my GPU usage in Divinity Original Sin 2 on Ultra is just 35% and I have a stable 60fps, whilst before the usage was at 100% and I had 5-10 fps max
Hope this helps anyone with a similar problem!

 
I've done this and i wanna thank u. I have a question tho. the drivers that i installed are one year old now. Do i need to update them with nvidia geforce experience right? if so, what was the point to uninstall them and reinstall the same drivers? thanks again
