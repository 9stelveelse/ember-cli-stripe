I was all ready to purchase Affinity programs but I am disappointed not to be able find a supported Graphtec Plug In to enable the exporting of Designer EPS s to Cutting Master 4.
 
Unfortunately Affinity Designer doesn't support any plugin capabilities currently - this is something we hope to add in a future update, however we have no timescale for this at this time, my apologies.

This is why you're really better off using a separate standalone cutting software to drive your cutter, rather than using a plug-in that traps you into dependency upon a single general-purpose drawing program. My cutters are Rowland. But if your hardware is Graphtec, have you not looked into one of the Graphtec Studio applications?
 
With a separate cutting-prep application, you can use whatever drawing software you want, so long as it can export to a common vector file format that the cutting application can import. In the case of Affinity, that would be SVG, which is indicated on Graphtec's site as one of the formats supported by Graphtec Studio. You would:
 
Typically, what actually drives cutters is just ordinary simple pen-up, move-to, pen-down HPGL instructions. So even when you use your Graphtec plug-in for Illustrator, what's really going on is, the plug-in is converting the Bezier curves to plotter language and then sending it to the cutter's driver.
 
There is a lot of functionality in a dedicated standalone cutting application, too. As for steps 2 and 3; no. That's what enables me to use the single familiar cutting / driving application with all the vector-based drawing program I have, and to use files provided by others outside my shop.
 
Does anyone know of a **cheap plugin** for cutting vinyl directly within **illustrator CS3 for MAC OS 10 snow leopard?** ... or a utility that will do the same thing on a Mac?

I dont want an all singing all dancing program that will cost hundreds of pounds and allow me to design the artwork etc, i just need to cut the vectors that i will create in Illustrator, so a plugin would be ideal but despite searching I cant find anything for a Mac.
 
Thanks also to Scott Falkner, i followed your link and contacted www.graphtecamerica.com who make the plugin Cutting Master 2 for a link to download the free plugin. I am not sure yet if it even supports my plotter but i will give it a go.
 
It would be nice if Adobe could make a plugin that does the job, just a plotting driver that will allow you to cut from Illustrator on a mac. I have searched high and low for a mac plugin and can seem to find any...... I AM AMAZED! and dissapointed at the same time.
 
I understand the frustration. Being I'm in the signmaking business I do all of my graphics inside Adobe Illustrator saved in a CD (CorelDraw format) which has a plug installed called SignWorks (Windows OS). Unfortunatly all signmaking software is Windows OS. Reason for that is when signs were first done by handpainting it later transitioned into the digital world (1990) by a proprietary company known as Gerber Scientific. Gerber is neither windows or mac but manufactured a letter cutting machine. Gerber was also the first signmaking machine manufacturer. Their first product meeting this digital signmaking era was the Signmaker 4B. It had a built in motherboard along with fonts and its cutting plotter sitting ontop of it. This was a complete signmaking machine which became known as the workhorse of digital signmaking. As the sign industry grew in particualarly the buildboard business large format printers got in the action and started developing software to work with their huge (25'-35') printers. At this point all of the software were Windows OS not Macs. In other words, Windows jumped in the action while Apple didnt have the confidence that it would be a profitable business investment. Unfortanantly they were millions upon millions of dollars wrong. I believe there was some kind of deal with Windows and the signmaking industries that may have locked the door legally keeping Apple outside the game. Why they didnt pursue getting in the profitable signmaking industry developing Mac OS softaware remains a mystery till this day. That is why there is no cutting software (plug ins) to produce signs or graphics in a Mac OS platform that could've been used inside a vector program like Adobe Illustrator - it would have to done the way I do it but again it remains inside Windows when it has to go to a cutting plotter for production. So you may have to make that switch from Mac to Windows. Sorry for the lengthy history but that is basically was happen historically.
 
I have been using XFCut cuting plug in for 5 years on my macOS. It works great. easy to create designs from Adobe Illustrator to your vinyl cutter plotter with only a click. the trial version may be downloaded from .
 
I run Flexi on my design computer along with Adobe suite, even if I am designing In Ai or PS, I can open it directly in Flexi and send it to my plotter if it's in vector format, or create a cut line layer of an image created in PS. Jpegs, pdfa, png files all easily converted and plotted.
 
I do have an old windows desktop, that I've had to use in a pinch that still has an older (unsupported by adobe) Ai program running on it. It's on my server network, so I just open the file there, if my laptop is tied up designing or rendering large files.
 
You can buss a mono track out to a stereo aux send, pan it center, and send it to a two track plugin just fine. Or, you can convert the mono track to a stereo one, although I think this will load down your processor a bit more.
 
this is probably a bug. it is fixed in svn, and will released in 2.5. the other possibility is that you have inadvertently ended up with a track that really does have 2 inputs and 1 output (unlikely).
 
The saturation and tone-shaping is well crafted on these plugins and I'm particularly fond of the modulation shape. A nice addition to the standard formula of a low-fidelity plug-in is the four modes: Broken, Lost, Old, New.
 
Another aesthetically pleasing and fairly self explanatory plugin for the most part. This one has a cool looking aesthetic, reminiscent of a 1980s stereo, VU meters and all. The controls take a more conventional approach to naming, and offer numerical values that are always on display (which I prefer to having to hover a mouse over a dial to see what its value is).
 
Lastly, there are 65 Noise impulse responses taken from a range of equipment such as cassette players, records players, vintage synthesizers and more, which are ideal for adding a little dirt and character to your productions.
 
Notice the Tape Delay is set to 100% wet, 0% dry, with a delay time of zero. The key here is not to use it as a delay, but rather, to take advantage of its Modulation and Character controls and saturation colouration to emulate the sound and feel of an aged cassette player.
 
Hi! I've got a new plugin you can have! These plugins come in Mac AU, and Mac, Windows and Linux VST. They are state of the art sound, have no DRM, and have totally minimal generic interface so you focus on your sounds.
 
**Physical modeling for enhanced realism
**While many vinyl plugins are content to use looping samples of vinyl noise, Needlepoint uses physical modeling to achieve its incredible sounds. It synthesizes all sorts and sizes of detritus and distress on a record: hair, dust mites, scratches, warping, and more. These are not randomly modeled, but rather accurately distributed onto a virtually rotating, algorithmic platter.

I followed all the advice in this article, yet I still can't use the plugin. I have created a dedicated folder for my VST plugins with the path "C:\Program Files\VSTplugins", and put the .dll files and uninstaller together there. After selecting that path as the folder in the image in the article suggests, I tried opening the fx menu and selecting it, but it wasn't there.
 
That plugin exists in both 32 bit and 64 bit versions (I just checked this on my machine where I have it installed and where it is available to use in MM version 28.0.2.47). MM is 32 bit so cannot use the 64 bit version of the plug. Did you carefully check you were installing the 32 bit version?
 
**Vinyl Strip** is a multi-effect plugin featuring 6 modules: Distortion, Compressor, Bit Crusher, Tilt EQ, Vintage Reverb, and Vinylizer. The modules can be arranged in any combination by simple drag-n-drop. Vinyl Strip will add life and an old school touch to your samples and tracks, and achieve that classic vinyl record sound in your digital environment. The plugin is optimised to be lightweight on the CPU.
 
I absolutely love the Abbey Road Vinyl plugin. I use it on most of my tracks. However, sometimes I want the VST to be less present. If I turn down the WET knob in FL studio, it creates a phasing effect. Is there a way to avoid this? Thanks!
