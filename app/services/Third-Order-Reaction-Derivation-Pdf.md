Determine which graph results in a straight line. This graph reflects the order of the reaction. For this problem, the straight line should be in the 3rd graph, meaning the reaction is second order. The numbers should have are:
 
Determine the order of the reaction and the reaction constant, \(k\), for the reaction using the tactics described in the previous problem. The order of the reaction is second, and the value of k is 0.0269 M-2s-1. Since the reaction order is second, the formula for \(t\_1/2 = k^-1[A]\_0^-1\). This means that the half life of the reaction is 0.0259 seconds.

To understand the **third order reaction**, first, we should understand what the term order of a reaction means. The order of a reaction can be defined as the addition of the power of all the reactants taking part in that chemical reaction. The reaction is said to be third order when the minimum number of molecules required for the chemical reaction to take place is 3.

A third order reaction is a chemical reaction where the rate of reaction is proportional to the concentration of each reacting molecule. In this reaction, the rate is usually determined by the variation of three concentration terms.
 
To summarise, the order of reaction can be defined as the sum of the exponents of all the reactants present in that chemical reaction. If the order of that reaction is 3, then the reaction is said to be a third-order reaction.
 
For a zero-order reaction, the rate law is rate = k, where k is the rate constant. In the case of a zero-order reaction, the rate constant k will be expressed in concentration/time units, such as M/s.
 
If the reactant concentration increases, the reaction has zero-order kinetics. It has first-order kinetics if it has no effect. The reaction has second-order kinetics if increasing the reactant decreases the half life.
 
A zero-order reaction, unlike the other orders of reaction, has a rate that is independent of the reactant concentration (s). As a result, increasing or decreasing the concentration of the reacting species has no effect on the reaction rate.
 
Chemical kinematics deals with the rates of chemical reactions and their mechanisms. The rate constant in a rate law, such as the rate law d[A]/dt = k[A], is independent of concentration but depends on factors like temperature. The order of a reaction is the sum of the powers of the concentration terms in its rate equation. Common orders of reaction include zero-order, where the rate is independent of reactant concentration, first-order, where the rate depends on one concentration term, and second-order, where the rate depends on two concentration terms. Higher order reactions are also possible but are more complex.Read less
 
Chemistry is all about changes. How fast is a substance converted into another by a chemical reaction, and is the reaction feasible or not? The extent to which that reaction will proceed is all the questions that decide the course of a chemical reaction. Apart from feasibility and extent, other factors, like the rate of a reaction and the factors that determine the rate, are also crucial for a chemical reaction. For instance, what controls the rate at which the fuel burns in an auto engine? Which parameters determine how rapidly food gets spoiled?
 
It is a must to remember that the value of half-life varies from order to order. As the half-life formula changes for different reactions, so goes with its unit. The half-life formula and its unit for different order reactions are given below:
 
A. In 1907, Ernest Rutherford tracked down the concept of dating in radioactive elements, which is related to the half-life of the elements. In the 1950s, this dating term was abbreviated to half-life.
 
A. In brief, the radiological half-life is critical in radiation control as long-lived radionuclides, once liberated, are all over the place for longer than momentary species. Radionuclides that stay for a long period are revealed to the environment and will exist for a longer time than impermanent nuclides. It may require essential, longer-term observation of the environment to ensure that a person is not significantly unmasked. The value of the half-life of the substance aids in determining the period of existence of that substance in the environment.
 
The half-life of a sample refers to the amount of time it takes for half of a sample to react with the other half. Also included is the amount of time that a certain quantity requires to lower its initial value to half of its current value.
 
If we are interested in determining the half-life of this reaction, we must solve for the time at which the concentration, [A], is equal to half of what it was initially; in other words, we must solve for the time at which the concentration, [A], is equal to half of what it was initially.
 
As a result, for a zero-order reaction, the half-life and the initial concentration are precisely proportional to one another. As the starting concentration of the reaction grows, the half-life of the reaction becomes increasingly longer.
 
During a chemical process, the half-life of a species is defined as the amount of time it takes for the concentration of the same material to decline to half of its starting value. In a first-order reaction, the half-life of the reactant is equal to ln(2)/k, where k is the rate constant of the reaction and ln(2) is the half-life of the product.
 
The half-life of a reaction is the amount of time it takes for a reactant to reach one-half its starting concentration or pressure, whichever is greater. First-order reactions have half-lives that are independent of concentration and remain constant across time.
 
A zero-order reaction proceeds at a constant rate throughout its duration. The pace of a first-order reaction is determined by the concentration of one of the reactants in the reaction mixture. A second-order reaction rate is proportional to the square of the concentration of a reactant or to the product of the concentrations of two reactants in a given reaction mixture.

Ascorbic acid is of great interest in food, where it is both an essential vitamin and a natural preservative. Ascorbic acid is also vital for plants. It not only plays a role in photosynthesis, cell growth and signal transduction, but also helps defend from oxidative stress as the most abundant water-soluble antioxidant in plants1,2,3,4. Because of its importance for food and in plants, food chemists and botanists have performed the vast majority of studies of ascorbic acid oxidation chemistry1,2,3,4,5,6,7.
 
In mammalian systems, ascorbic acid is a common and important molecule with roles in metabolic function, oxidative stress responses and immune system maintenance taking place in epithelial lung lining fluid and other areas in the body8, 9.
 
Because ascorbic acid is a key antioxidant in lung lining fluid, ascorbic acid consumption is one of the assays used by atmospheric chemists to quantify aerosol oxidative potential17; aerosol oxidative potential is proving to be better at predicting adverse health outcomes than particle mass18. Ascorbate/ ascorbic acid consumption has been observed to be positively correlated with total iron and copper concentrations in ambient aerosol14.
 
Ascorbic acid can have both pro- and anti-oxidant roles, and it reacts with reactive oxygen species (ROS) and transition metals. Ascorbic acid can be readily oxidized by undergoing a one- or two-electron transfer, terminating the free radical-mediated chain reactions in foods and tissue, reducing lipid peroxidation and deterioration of foods6. The autoxidation of ascorbic acid by oxygen in the presence of transition metals, especially cupric (Cu(II)) and ferric (Fe(III)) ions accounts for the majority of loss of this ascorbic acid activity in food. Despite its role as an efficient antioxidant, ascorbic acid can also accelerate oxidative deterioration of flavor and color in food through Fenton-type radical reactions6, 19. This pro-oxidant effect occurs when transition metal ions are present, and the level of available ascorbic acid is relatively low and not sufficient to scavenge the radicals formed by Fenton-type reactions. In both food and physiological conditions, the key loss pathways for ascorbic acid are via ROS and transition metals, especially Fe(III) and Cu(II). However, for the transition metal reactions, the stoichiometries, mechanisms and rate constants are all very uncertain. Further, while the ROS ascorbic acid reactions are reasonably well understood from a mechanistic standpoint, the range of rate constants in the literature for these reactions spans about a factor of 1520,21,22,23,24,25.
 
Ascorbate reactions with iron and copper are central to metal-mediated antioxidant chemistry, and it is clear that ascorbate reacts overwhelmingly with the oxidized
