While you can land a job with an associate degree in human resource management, an HR manager typically has a bachelor's degree in human resources, business administration, or a related field. The knowledge, skills, and critical thinking experience you gain from your education are essential for a managerial role, which involves planning, managing, and decision making.
 
Rue Dooley, SHRM-SCP, the HR knowledge advisor for the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), says a growing number of HR professionals have master's degrees, so you may want to consider earning a graduate degree after you're grounded in your career and know which direction you want to take it. "The more formal education a student can get, the better," says Dooley.

Entry-level positions such as HR specialist are likely to offer lower salaries because you don't have on-the-job experience yet. But you can increase your opportunities and earning potential with experience from your first roles.
 
Professional certifications can also increase your earning power. A certification demonstrates to others that you've mastered specific knowledge and skills beyond what you learned in your degree program.
 
While many HR managers are generalists who manage a department, you may have the opportunity to manage one or more specialties, such as recruiting and hiring, in a larger organization if you have the right experience.

Specializing in a particular industry can also make you more valuable to prospective employers. For example, working as an HR manager in healthcare can allow you to develop expertise specific to that field and the challenges of working with employees in that industry.

Human resources management is a position that spans across industries, and jobs are plentiful. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) predicts that HR management jobs will grow 7 percent from 2021 to 2031, around average for all occupations.
 
Human resources managers need to be highly motivated, organized, and ethical as well as possess good leadership skills. It's also important for these managers to have the right training and education to perform their duties effectively.
 
Getting the right education is the first step to becoming a human resources manager. A bachelor's degree is typically the minimum requirement for this job position, but some employers prefer candidates with a master's degree in human resource management or a Master of Business Administration (MBA) with a concentration in HR.

HR departments also act as an important bridge between company employees and leaders, mediating workplace conflicts, ensuring compliance with employment laws and regulations and working with executives on long-term strategic planning.
 
Human resources managers are leaders within HR departments, overseeing the functions of an organization that takes care of its workers. The role can vary depending on where you work, but many of the core responsibilities are consistent across organizations.
 
As the COVID-19 pandemic changed how many employees worked, the human resources profession was challenged to support the workforce in new ways. "From the adoption of digital workplace policies to the mitigation of risk and crisis management, human resource professionals led and implemented business transformation practices at an unprecedented rate," Jammer said.
 
Many HR managers may have a bachelor's degree in human resources. These programs address issues HR professionals will likely encounter in the field. Some programs will offer scenario-based learning opportunities that allow you to apply your knowledge to different situations. You could also gain experience in assessing problems, crafting responses, fostering communication and building critical thinking and writing skills.
 
Another option you could consider is earning an HR certificate before a degree. An HR certificate could be a less intensive way to kick off your HR education and help you get your foot in the door for a career in the field.
 
Earning a business administration degree with a concentration in human resources can give you a unique combination of business acumen and industry-specific knowledge that can set you apart when looking for HR manager jobs, said SNHU business adjunct faculty member **Dr. Dean Gualco**, an author and human resources director with more than 25 years of experience.
 
Volunteering for HR roles at local nonprofits, museums and other organizations can also provide professional experience, said Jammer. Even taking on more responsibilities in your current job can help you gain the skills needed to succeed.
 
For example, at SNHU, you can complete coursework in the HR bachelor's degree program designed to help prepare you for HRCI's Associate Professional in Human Resources (aPHR) certification exam. There are also industry credentials sponsored by HRCI embedded throughout the program.
 
Your pacing could alter the timeframe, too. For example, if you have transfer credits, you could finish your degree faster. Or, if you earn your degree part-time or take some terms off, it might take you a little longer.
 
Since online classes work a bit differently than traditional college classes, often operating on shorter academic terms instead of semesters, you don't have to wait as long to start your degree either. Making online courses worth your time.
 
In addition to finding related work or volunteer experience, networking with other HR leaders can give you a leg up when finding HR leadership roles. Getting involved with a local SHRM club or chapter and attending networking events can help you make connections with industry leaders in your area and help you find work.
