Corporate customers can activate Office products within the corporate network by using the local KMS server without connecting to Microsoft activation servers on the Internet. Earlier we have already considered the peculiarities of KMS activation of MS Office 2013, and the main principles and approaches to the MS Office 2021, 2019, and 2016 activation on a KMS server remained unchanged.

After your KMS server is activated on Microsoft, the current KMS server configuration is displayed. In the Product Key Management list, the entry **Name: Office 16, VOLUME\_KMS\_channel** (Office 21, VOLUME\_KMSCLIENT channel or Office 19, VOLUME\_KMSCLIENT channel) with the licensing status **Licensed**should appear.
 
Close the VAT window, and press ENTER in the update tool console. The information about the installed KMS key can be obtained using SKU-ID (displayed in the final step of the KMS server installation):
 
Those, if you have a valid SRV DNS record for the KMS server in the domain (you can find a KMS server in a domain with the command: nslookup -type=srv \_vlmcs.\_tcp.woshub.com), and you installed the corporate edition of MS Office (Volume License), a copy of Office should be activated automatically after installation on a computer in an AD domain.
 
You can also specify the name or IP address of the KMS server through the following REG\_SZ registry parameter KeyManagementServiceName in the HKLM\Software\Microsoft\OfficeSoftwareProtectionPlatform\ (you can deploy this registry key in the domain using GPO).
 
GVLK Keys for Microsoft Office 2021/2019/2016All corporate Office 2021/2019/2016 versions are installed with Generic Volume License Keys (GVLK). These keys are public and accessible to everyone on Microsoft TechNet. Due to them, all Office product versions are automatically activated if there is a KMS server on the network. So, in most cases, it is not required to specify the GVLK key for Office.

If you are trying to install a KMS server for Office 2021/2019/2016 on Windows Server 2019/2016, keep in mind that it has a number of problems with the launch of the Volume Activated Services Tool. When you try to activate an Office KMS server through the Volume Activated Services GUI, you can receive an error:
 
If i have an environment of 100 workstation that I reimage every 6 months and i only have 120 VL of office 2016.
 When I activate the 100 workstation, I will use up the 100 licenses but what if i reimage the computers on the 6 months. What will happen? will only 20 computers be activated or all 100 computers of office 2016 be activated?
 Thanks
 
Assume I setup KMS server correctly, Is the KMS smart enough to count that I just have 100 computers with office that I reformat/activate all the time so its still 100 licenses compare to a kms counter that just keeps increasing?
 
Hi Great Article.
 Quick question which you may be able to answer for me. We have an environment with 1000 computers. We have purchased 800 licenses initially of Office Standard 2016 and using KMS with VAMT 3.1 they activated fine.
 We then went and got a further 180 licenses, but we got a different KMS and MAK key for the new 180.
 Do I need to run slmgr.vbs with new KMS key and if so will this overwrite my original KMS key for the 800
 
End of 2020, just wanted to check in and let everybody know this works beautifully on a 2016 or 2019 server and I verified it works for activating clients with Office 2016 or Office 2019. Thank you so much for this awesome tutorial.
 
Hi !
 Thanks for this great article.
 However, when you have several GVLK keys for the same Office 2016/2019 product and that you encounter the issue to add new keys from the GUI, how can I specify multiple GVLK keys for my KMS server using the slmgr utility from command prompt ?
 Thanks in advance.
 
Welcome to the August 2023 update. We have lots of features this month including the new layout switcher for Power BI, SSD caching in Synapse Data Warehouse, in-line Python support for KQL in Synapse Real-time Analytics, lookup activity for Data Factory Dataflows, and much more. Continue reading for more details on our new features!
 
We are introducing the new bubble range scaling setting for scatter chart and map visuals! This setting gives report creators more control over how the bubble (marker) sizes respond to the data, making it more accurate or distinctive based on preference.
 
With the **magnitude**option, the bubble areas closely follow the data proportions. With the **data-range**option, the bubble size limits are mapped to data minimum and maximum. The **auto**option, which is the default setting for new reports, selects the appropriate option based on data characteristics. For more information, visit our docs.
 
Whether you prefer SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), Tabular Editor, DAX Studio, or something else, you can connect to your Direct Lake datasets using XMLA endpoints and perform operations such as deploying, customizing, merging, scripting, debugging, and testing. You can use tools like Azure DevOps or GitHub to implement source control, versioning, and continuous integration for your data models. You can automate and streamline your development and deployment processes. You can also use PowerShell or REST APIs to automate tasks such as refreshing or applying changes to your Direct Lake datasets. XMLA Write is incredibly powerful and the key to data modelling efficiency and productivity. For more information about XMLA Write support in general, check out the article Dataset connectivity with the XMLA endpoint in the product documentation.
 
We are excited to announce that we have finalized Dataset Scale-Out configuration APIs and completed the replica synchronization feature. Specifically, you no longer need to enable Scale-Out at the workspace level by using a burdensome XMLA request. The XMLA command is deprecated and will no longer work. You can now enable Scale-Out on a dataset-by-dataset basis using the Power BI REST API for datasets. You also no longer need to synchronize read replicas manually if you want to take advantage of automatic replica synchronization. Automatic replica synchronization is enabled by default. However, it is also possible to disable automatic synchronization to synchronize the read/write and read replicas of a dataset manually for controlled refresh isolation.

T-SQL queries targeting massive amounts of data not fitting in-memory cache suffer from cache misses and higher latency due to repetitive reads from remote storage. SSD caching stores frequently accessed data on local disks in highly optimized format, significantly reducing IO latency and accelerating query processing.
 
We are thrilled to announce session sharing in Fabric through High Concurrency mode for Data Engineering and Data Science workloads. You can run notebooks simultaneously on the same cluster without compromising performance or security when paying for a single session. Session sharing is strictly within a single user boundary offering enhanced security and isolation also allowing you to do more while paying less.
 
Fabric KQL Database supports running Python code embedded in Kusto Query Language (KQL) using the python() plugin . The plugin runtime is hosted in a sandbox, an isolated and secured environment hosted on KQL Database compute nodes. This sandbox contains the language engine as well as common mathematical and scientific packages. The plugin extends KQL native functionalities with a huge archive of OSS packages, enabling Fabric users to run advanced algorithms, such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, statistical tests, time series analysis and many more as part of the KQL query.
 
The Python plugin runs a user-defined function (UDF) using a Python script. The Python script gets tabular data as its input, and produces tabular output. The plugin is disabled by default. Before you start, enable the Python plugin in your KQL database. To enable the plugin browse to your KQL Database, select Manage -> Plugins, and enabled the plugin by toggling the button to On.
 
With the introduction of the ability to set the behavior of a query to be staged or not, you can now set all your queries to be evaluated without any staging and load the data directly to a destination of your choice.
 
When creating a Dataflow Gen2, we are now modifying the maximum number of entities that can be part of a particular Dataflow. The new maximum number of entities is 50. If you have 51 or more entities in your Dataflow, you will receive a warning letting you know that you need to reduce the number of entities to a maximum
