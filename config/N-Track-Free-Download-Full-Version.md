Lanes are belonging to one track. With track versions you can chain several tracks with the the same track version id and switch them together, with one key command. So it is easy to check alternative versions of a bridge for example.
 
These are the most common versions. They are added in a social field in the app, not in the title. In the stores, however, the version will be found right next to the title, either in parenthesis or after a hyphen.

If there are two different version entries, "Live" and "Acoustic" for example, the first should go behind the title in between brackets and the second in the version field. Title: Cup of Tea (Live) Version: Acoustic (Live must be the first version)

If the version title includes time and venue, it should be formatted as Live at Place, Year (or the date when applicable). If the release is in Portuguese use Ao Vivo and in Spanish use En Vivo or En Directo.
 
Explicit (bad language) and Clean (where the bad language has been "beeped out" or some other way removed) are added to a release but not as versions. In the Amuse app, there is a special place to mark whether it is explicit or not.
 
Let's say I have a single file, foo.txt, that I want to manage with Git, and I don't want to move it into its own directory out of (let's say) /Users/me/Documents, which also has a ton of other files I don't want to include in a repo with foo.txt. Is this possible?
 
Using a normal .git directory would not work, because it would limit me to ever versioning that one file, or force me to include any other files in the same repo, and I want to be able to version other files in that directory in their own repo.
 
Along with the separate repository, git has created a hidden file .git in the worktree directory. You can delete it if you like (it may be useful if you are going to track some other file(s) in your worktree directory separately in some separate repository(ies)).
 
I'm glad to hear that your team is looking to move to continuous releases. This is a great way to improve the speed and quality of your software development process. But as you pointed out, it does come with its own challenges. 

First of all, I think it's completely acceptable to keep using versions. It does add a bit of overhead when you are releasing twice a week, but you can keep it fairly lightweight. I've seen versions used in that context by many other teams.
 
If the team insist on not using versions, I do recommend the use of Epics to group smaller tasks into larger pieces of work. An epic should be large enough to be a significant undertaking, but not so large that it is impossible to complete in a reasonable amount of time.
 
Nice to hear you are moving towards continuous delivery. We are developing Release Management Apps for Jira but we also eat our own dog food. Thus, we also do continuous delivery and deliver apps to production every week/twice a week.
 
Zoom strives to strike a delicate balance between providing a secure platform, the latest features and enhancements, and a reasonable range of supported app versions, in order to support longer update schedules for larger Enterprise customers. To this goal, Zoom manages our desktop and mobile apps by:
 
This version is the absolute minimum app version you can use to join or host a Zoom Meeting, use Zoom Chat, make and receive Zoom Phone calls, or otherwise access and use Zoom products on the desktop app or mobile app. Users below this minimum version must update their desktop app or mobile app, before they are able to sign-in or join a meeting. Users that cannot immediately update can join the meeting with the web app instead.
 
Starting in November 2022, Zoom will be enforcing a new minimum version every 90 days. This change is in line with industry practices and designed to help ensure that Zoom users receive the latest Zoom features, as well as any privacy and security enhancements we make to the platform. Please note that while there will be a minimum Zoom app version required, we may require additional updates outside of this release window to address additional security or compliance features. We encourage customers to refer to our release notes for any included security enhancements or Security Bulletins to learn more about fixed issues.
 
The Fast and Slow tracks are available when the Auto Update functionality is enabled for the desktop apps, either through IT-managed deployments or personally choosing to enable Auto Update in app settings.
 
The Fast track is for those interested in the latest features and functionality. Selecting this option provides users with the latest updates with each release. At launch, every new app version is added to the fast track and is distributed to a percentage of random users on the fast track each day, with the rollout typically accelerating over the course of the week.
 
The Slow track is for those wanting less frequent changes and a more mature feature set. After evaluating telemetry and internal metrics, Zoom determines if/when\* a new version is promoted to the Slow track. Releases promoted to the slow track are distributed to a percentage of random users on the slow track each day, with the rollout typically accelerating over the course of the week.
 
**\*Important note**: Not every released version is promoted to the Slow track, so users on the Slow track, which is the default for both individual and managed users, will not see the desktop app update to every version along the way. apps on the slow track will likely only see updates every 1-2 months.
 
When eligible for an update, the app downloads the new installer package and waits until the Zoom app is fully shut-down, either by fully quitting the Zoom app or restarting the device. Upon the next startup of the Zoom app, the installer launches first, installs the newer version, and then opens the Zoom app.
 
When versioning is enabled in your list or library, you can store, track, and restore items in a list and files in a library whenever they change. Libraries can track both major versions, such as those in which a new section was added to a document, and minor versions, such as those in which a spelling error was corrected. Lists can track only major versions. For more information on versioning, see How versioning works in lists and libraries.
 
If you are working with a Microsoft Office document, such as a Word, Excel, orPowerPoint file, you can view version history from the app view rather than returning to the list or library to view the history.
 
The next example is from a Microsoft Word file. Only major versions appear in this version history. This could mean that only major versions are enabled in the document library, or it could mean that you only have permission to view major versions, not minor ones.
 
You can simply view the file or, while it's open, you can choose to make it your current version by clicking Restore in the yellow banner at the top of the file, or you can compare the selected version to the current version by clicking Compare.
 
Versioning is on by default in SharePoint libraries, and off by default in SharePoint lists. Versioning needs to be turned on to see the version-history option on menus or in ribbons. To turn on version history, see Enable and configure versioning for a list or library.
 
When you set up versioning, you set a maximum number of versions to save. When the maximum number of versions are saved, SharePoint deletes the oldest to accommodate newer versions. You can set SharePoint to save more versions, up to the system limit. For more information, see How versioning works in lists and libraries.

Hi,
Very often we tend to create several test versions of an Arduino project on our computer, without any version control.
It may become confusing after uploading to remember which version is currently running, especially if some time has passed since uploading.
For that, I use (and recommend) to add to any project setup() I make a header that automatically prints out on startup or reset the file name, date and time of saving.
The code is simple: (Can also use formatted printout sprintf or printf)
 
If local saving I use a folder with the project name then the project name + Version number (This creates a folder with the same name containing the project file(s)), and have a text file in the main folder with notes of additions/tests/todo etc.
 
Yes, you are right, its the compilation time.
Adding a file to the project in its original folder is fine. The advantage of the code I added is in it being the last running version. I often have several files open, and not sure which one was loaded to the device. By pressing the reset key I get that information. It is also useful when the device is run on its final destination without the IDE or the source files, where any serial reader can show the version info.
 
I do something similar on every Arduino project. This way when I pick up a breadboard project that I want to resume working on, I don't have to search (guess) for the project files. Just plug in the USB, enable the console, then power or reset the board.
 
Amazon Redshift regularly releases cluster versions. Your Amazon Redshift clusters are patched during your system maintenance window. The timing of the patch depends on your AWS Region and maintenance window settings. You can view or change your maintenance window settings from the Amazon Redshift console. For more information about maintenance, see Cluster maintenance.
