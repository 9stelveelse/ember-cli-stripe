Why on might ask; simply because flourishing can only be evaluated and described by the individual. In his book Flourish, Dr. Martin Seligman brings up an important point about the association to the Well-being Model as opposed to the Authentic Happiness model in Positive Psychology, the point being, regarding flourishing, the motive is not to increase happiness in self and in the world, but to increase flourishing (positive growth) in self and in the world1.

The ability to flourish is defined as the ability for a person to grow as a human being through good times and through life struggles. It is a very individual journey of living as experienced and valued by the individual. How one gets there is connected by the holistic recognition that happiness and flourishing are connected to elements such as finding individual meaning through relationships, courage, leisure time, what we love to do in life, building creativity, love, and connections. Flourishing is the product of the pursuit and engagement of an authentic life that brings inner joy and happiness through meeting goals, being connected with life passions, and relishing in accomplishments through the peaks and valleys of life.
 
Appreciably, in the research of this area in Positive Psychology, the work of Felicia Huppert and Timothy So highlighted and crafted the core features and explanations associated with flourishing. The authors defined flourishing as a product of characteristics a person possesses or recognizes as resources. The criteria included a model of specific core features that must be present, and 3 of six additional features that complete the recipe. The core features include:
 
While the core list might seem like benchmark thresholds, we must mention again that these can only be evaluated and defined by the individual. For example: some people are overtly happy and this shows through energy and enthusiasm; a bubbly person if you will, while others may happily fade into the background enjoying the moments from the bleachers. Given the different ways of being in the world, both can equally evaluate their life on the positive emotion side. The same holds true for the idea of engagement and interest. Some people enjoy difficult tasks that stab to the core of challenging body, mind and spirit to great depths, while others find engagement and interest in small moment to moment experiences that hold curiosity, attention or concentration; perhaps even daily conversation at the bus stop. Some people might see these bus stop conversations as trite or trivial, searching for a grand meaning in life, while others capture glimpses, smiles and conversations as small pieces to make up their meaning in life.
 
The additional six features (where just three are needed) add to the recipe of flourishing, and are features defined by how we recognize and use resources, and process information that generates favorable or positive outcomes through motivation, behaviors, revaluation and adjustment.

Flourishing is one of the most important and promising topics studied in positive psychology. Not only does it relate to many other positive concepts, it holds the key to improving the quality of life for people around the world. Discovering the pieces to the flourishing puzzle and learning how to effectively apply research findings to real life has tremendous implications for the way we live, love, and relate to one another.
 
Using this model as our framework, we can understand flourishing as the state that we create when we tend to each aspect of the PERMA model: increasing our positive emotions, engaging with the world and our work (or hobbies), develop deep and meaningful relationships, find meaning and purpose in our lives, and achieve our goals through cultivating and applying our strengths and talents.
 
In addition to wellbeing, happiness, and life satisfaction, it has also been proposed that constructs like virtue and health be considered components of flourishing. In addition, financial stability and religious or spiritual health may also come into play (VanderWeele, 2017).
 
Although there is still much debate about the dimensions or aspects of flourishing, there is one thing that most scholars have agreed on when it comes to flourishing: it is not simply the opposite or absence of depression or mental illness.
 
In addition to the agreement that flourishing is not simply the absence of mental illness, there is also agreement that flourishing provides numerous benefits. For example, flourishing has been found to have the following impacts:
 
The PERMA-Profiler poses 23 questions on a scale from 0 to 10, measuring the five PERMA pillars (positive emotion, engagement, relationships, meaning, and accomplishment) via three questions each, as well as one question on overall wellbeing, three questions on negative emotions (sadness, anger, and anxiety), one question on loneliness, and three questions on self-perceived physical health.
 
This measure results in 7 domain scores (one for each of the five pillars, negative emotion, and health), an overall happiness/wellbeing score, and a loneliness score. A composite wellbeing score can be calculated by averaging all 15 PERMA items and the overall wellbeing item (Butler & Kern, 2016).
 
In addition to the actions outlined in this lecture, there are five other general qualities that set apart those who just get along from those who flourish. Consider these qualities carefully and think about how you tend to behave; do you embody these qualities, or could you do more to emulate them?

Although Seligman and his 2011 book increased the interest in flourishing, it was not the first exploration of the topic. Researchers Keyes and Haidt published an edited book on flourishing in 2002, which incorporated findings from the leading psychologists on happiness, wellbeing, and living the best life possible.
 
It was written just as positive psychology was emerging as a field in its own right. The book documents the forces that drove the field, emphasizing the influence of decades of focusing on mental illness on the development of positive psychology.
 
These explorations of positive, life-giving constructs provided an early guidebook for work in positive psychology, laying the foundations for hundreds of articles and books published in the years that followed.
 
Change is essential to growth. Embrace the unpredictability, accept your own painful process, and know opinion can never take away your personal truth. Allow yourself to flourish into a matured, improved version of yourself, but know that it takes time.

When I started my work in Positive Psychology, my original view was closest to Aristotle's - that everything we do is done in order to make us happy - but I actually detest the word happiness, which is so overused that it has become almost meaningless. It is an unworkable term for science, or for any practical goal such as education, therapy, public policy, or just changing your personal life. Moreover, the modern ear immediately hears "happy" to mean buoyant mood, merriment, good cheer, and smiling. "Happiness" historically is not closely tied to such hedonics - feeling cheerful or merry is a far cry from what Thomas Jefferson declared that we have the right to pursue - and it is an even further cry from my intentions for a positive psychology.
 
To understand what "happiness" is really about, the first step is to dissolve "happiness" into more workable terms. When I wrote *Authentic Happiness* a decade ago, I thought that happiness could be analyzed into three different elements that we choose for their own sakes: positive emotion, engagement, and meaning. Positive emotion refers to what we feel: pleasure, rapture, ecstasy, warmth, comfort, and other such emotions that contribute to the "pleasant life." Engagement is about flow: being one with the music, time stopping, and the loss of self-consciousness during an absorbing activity, experiences which contribute to the "engaged life." The third element is meaning. I go into flow while playing bridge, but after a long tournament, when I look in the mirror, I worry that I am fidgeting until I die. Human beings, ineluctably, want the "meaningful life": belonging to and serving something that you believe is bigger than you are. Happiness and life satisfaction, I thought, could be increa
