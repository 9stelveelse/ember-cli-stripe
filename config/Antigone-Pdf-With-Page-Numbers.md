The **sarus crane** (***Antigone antigone***) is a large nonmigratory crane found in parts of the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and northern Australia. The tallest of the flying birds, standing at a height of up to 1.8 m (5 ft 11 in), they are a conspicuous species of open wetlands in South Asia, seasonally flooded *Dipterocarpus* forests in Southeast Asia, and *Eucalyptus*-dominated woodlands and grasslands in Australia.[5]
 
The sarus crane is easily distinguished from other cranes in the region by its overall grey colour and the contrasting red head and upper neck. They forage on marshes and shallow wetlands for roots, tubers, insects, crustaceans, and small vertebrate prey. Like other cranes, they form long-lasting pair bonds and maintain territories within which they perform territorial and courtship displays that include loud trumpeting, leaps, and dance-like movements. In India, they are considered symbols of marital fidelity, believed to mate for life and pine the loss of their mates, even to the point of starving to death.
 
In 1743 the English naturalist George Edwards included an illustration and a description of the sarus crane in the first volume of his *A Natural History of Uncommon Birds*. He used the English name "The Greater Indian Crane". Edwards based his hand-coloured etching on a live specimen that he had drawn at the London home of the Admiral Charles Wager.[6] When in 1758 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his *Systema Naturae* for the tenth edition, he placed the sarus crane or *Grus major Indica* in Latin[4] with the herons and cranes in the genus *Ardea*. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name *Ardea antigone* and cited Edwards' work.[7] The specific epithet is based on Greek mythology. Antigone was the daughter of the Trojan king Laomedon. She was turned into a stork for comparing her own beauty with the goddess Hera. Linnaeus appears to have confused this myth with that of Gerana, queen of the pigmies, who considered herself more beautiful than Hera and was turned into a crane.[8] The sarus crane was formerly placed in the genus *Grus*, but a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2010 found that the genus, as then defined, was polyphyletic.[9] In the resulting rearrangement to create monophyletic genera, four species, including the sarus crane, were placed in the resurrected genus *Antigone* that had originally been erected by German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach in 1853.[10][11]
 
Analysis of mitochondrial DNA from a limited number of specimens suggests that gene flow occurred within the continental Asian populations until the 20th-century reductions in range, and that Australia was colonized only in the Late Pleistocene, some 35,000 years ago.[16] This has been corroborated by DNA microsatellite analyses on a large and widely distributed set of individuals in the sample.[14] This study suggests further that the Australian population shows low genetic variability. As there exists the possibility of (limited) hybridization with the genetically distinct brolga, the Australian sarus crane can be expected to be an incipient species.[14]
 
The common name 'sarus' is from the Hindi name (*sāras*) for the species. The Hindi word is derived from the Sanskrit word *sarasa* for the "lake bird", (sometimes corrupted to *sārhans*).[18] British soldiers in colonial India who hunted the birds corrupted the name to *serious*[19] or even *cyrus*.[20]
 
The adult sarus crane is very large, with grey wings and body, a bare red head and part of the upper neck, a greyish crown, and a long, greenish-grey, pointed bill. In flight, the long neck is held straight, unlike that of a heron (which folds it back), and the black wing tips can be seen; the crane's long, pink legs trail behind them. This bird has a grey ear covert patch, orange-red irises, and a greenish-grey bill. Juveniles have a yellowish base to the bill and the brown-grey head is fully feathered.[13]
 
While individuals from northern populations are among the heaviest cranes, alongside the red-crowned and wattled cranes, and the largest in their range, birds f
