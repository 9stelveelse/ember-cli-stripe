You must take this test if your vehicle, or a vehicle you are required to drive for your job, has air brakes. For the exam, you must know the parts of a single and dual air brake system as well as how to inspect and use them. This test can be taken by Class A, B, and C license holders.
 
The combination endorsement covers the information you need for driving all combination vehicles, such as tractor-trailers, straight truck with trailers, doubles, and triples. This combination vehicles practice test covers how to drive combinations safely, handling combination air brakes, and more.
 
The tanker vehicles test is for individuals who will be hauling liquid or gaseous materials in tanks. Hauling a tank or tanks require a tanker endorsement if a tank has an individual rating of over 119 gallons or a combined capacity of 1,000 or more gallons.
 
This pre-trip inspection practice test will prepare you for the internal and external portions of the vehicle inspection exam, where you will be expected to be able to walk around your vehicle, touch items, and explain to an examiner why items must be inspected before a trip.
 
Many people arrive at the DMV overconfident and underprepared, neglecting simple steps that would ensure they pass. Here are 10 steps every aspiring commercial driver should take to prepare for the CDL or CLP knowledge exam.
 
As you earn your Class A, Class B or Class C CDL, you can also earn endorsements. Endorsements allow you to drive certain vehicles or groups of vehicles such as single or combination trucks, tankers, doubles, school buses and passenger vehicles. The more endorsements you hold, the greater your chances to make more money and advance your career. You'll need to pass a separate knowledge exam and/or road exam for each endorsement you want to get. Learn more about CDL endorsements and restrictions.

Your CDL test is the first step to a professional truck driving career in a trucking company. After you've studied your state's CDL handbook, the best thing you can do is either sign up for a costly CDL training program or take a free CDL practice test that simulates your state's actual knowledge test. Driving-Tests.org provides a general knowledge test, as well as practice tests for specific commercial vehicle endorsements, such as air brakes test, school bus, and hazardous material (HazMat endorsement). There's also a practice test for pre-trip inspection - it will come in handy before your CDL road test. These tests are valid for both commercial driver license and CDL permit (CLP).
 
Think of this as your own CDL study guide for each endorsement. Every practice test has multiple-choice questions in the same format you'll find on your state's CDL test. These questions are phrased like the ones on your state's official knowledge test. Most of the questions come with a hint to help you choose the right answer. Each correct answer comes with an explanation that has been carefully written to help you become more familiar with the topic of the question. We want you to be able to answer questions on those topics correctly even if they are worded a bit differently. Please read each explanation; it is based on your state's CDL manual and DMV/DOT website.
 
This practice exam covers a wide range of topics that you'll need to know about to pass your CDL knowledge test and enter the trucking industry. These topics include aggressive drivers, braking techniques, cargo safety, distracted drivers, drunk driving laws, emergency preparedness, road and weather conditions, and safe backing.
 
No, we certainly did not forget about air brakes, combination vehicles, or hazardous materials! These topics are complex enough to deserve separate treatment. Just as states typically require you to pass specialized knowledge tests on those topics, we offer our own specialized practice tests on air brakes, combination vehicles, and hazardous materials. By studying our CDL practice tests, you'll be on your way to obtaining your Class A CDL, Class B CDL, or Class C CDL license. Remember that you'll also need to fill out the Medical History portion of the MER form (MCSA-5875) and also obtain a copy of the Medical Examiner Certificate form (MCSA-5876).
 
We recommend that you keep taking the test until you become fully comfortable with the subject matter and receive a score high enough to boost your confidence about your upcoming CDL exam. A high score will bring you closer to passing your CDL knowledge test, so practice as many times as you'd like. There are no fees, and you won't even have to register.
 
The rules usually forbid the use of cargo heaters, including automatic cargo heater/air conditioner units. Unless you have read all the related rules, do not load the above products in a cargo space that has a heater.
 
Our **CDL practice tests** are designed to help test your knowledge of the CDL Manual and sharpen your skills for taking the CDL permit and endorsement exams.

Our High Road CDL Training Program is by far the easiest and most effective way to learn the materials necessary for passing your written CDL exams and preparing for a great start to your career.

With the knowledge assessment conquered, the subsequent stage involves a practical assessment, a twofold evaluation encompassing an on-road driving assessment and an off-road skills assessment. The on-road segment evaluates your adeptness in safely navigating a heavy vehicle through public roads. Conversely, the off-road skills assessment delves into your proficiency in executing maneuvers specific to heavy vehicles.
 
Ensuring robust preparedness for the practical assessment necessitates substantial hands-on experience driving heavy vehicles. This hands-on practice cultivates the indispensable skills and confidence indispensable for stellar performance. Furthermore, consider enrolling in a myVicRoads account to verify your licence status before the assessment. An outdated licence or a Fines Victoria sanction could render your test results null and necessitate payment for a fresh evaluation.
 
Crucially, bear in mind that the validity of both the knowledge and practical assessments for a heavy vehicle licence spans 12 months. Failure to remit the requisite fees or satisfy the evidence of identity requisites within this temporal window mandates a reiteration of the tests. Moreover, assessments undertaken during a Fines Victoria licence sanction hold no validity, warranting a fresh evaluation post-sanction culmination.
 
There are five types of truck licences (LR - light rigid, MR - medium rigid, HR - heavy rigid, HC - heavy combination, and MC - multi combination). To get a start with your heavy vehicle licence you will need to have held a car (Class C) licence for at least a year for an LR or MR then pass the relevant knowledge test. If you want to jump straight to an HR licence then you must have held your car licence for at least 2 years. You can practice on this website for your truck knowledge test
