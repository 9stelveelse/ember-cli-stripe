Originally launched as an open source tool in 1998, its enterprise edition became a commercial product in 2005. Nessus now encompasses several products that automate point-in-time vulnerability assessments of a network's attack surface, with the goal of enabling enterprise IT teams to stay ahead of cyber attackers by proactively identifying and fixing vulnerabilities as the tool discovers them, rather than after attackers exploit them.
 
Nessus identifies software flaws, missing patches, malware, denial-of-service vulnerabilities, default passwords and misconfiguration errors, among other potential flaws. When Nessus discovers vulnerabilities, it issues an alert that IT teams can then investigate and determine what -- if any -- further action is required.

Nessus is known for its vast plugin database. These plugins are dynamically and automatically compiled in the tool to improve its scan performance and reduce the time required to assess, research and remediate vulnerabilities. Plugins can be customized to create specific checks unique to an organization's application ecosystem.
 
Nessus contains a feature called Predictive Prioritization, which uses algorithms to categorize vulnerabilities by their severity to aid IT teams in determining which threats are most urgent to address. Each vulnerability is assigned a Vulnerability Priority Rating (VPR), which uses a scale from 0 to 10, with 10 being the highest risk, to rate its severity: critical, high, medium or low. IT teams can also use pre-built policies and templates to quickly find vulnerabilities and understand the threat situation.
 
Another Nessus feature is Live Results, which performs intelligent vulnerability assessment in offline mode with every plugin update. It removes the need to run a scan to validate a vulnerability, creating a more efficient process to assess, prioritize and remediate security issues.
 
Nessus also provides the ability to create configurable reports in a variety of formats, including Hypertext Markup Language, comma-separated values and Nessus Extensbile Markup Language. Reports can be filtered and customized depending on what information is most useful, such as vulnerability types, vulnerabilities by host, vulnerabilities by client, etc.
 
Meanwhile, the Nessus packet capture feature enables teams to debug and troubleshoot scanning issues quickly. In this way, it minimizes interruptions and provides continuous protection for the enterprise IT environment.

Nessus provides a fast, user-friendly way to find and fix vulnerabilities in many kinds of IT assets, including cloud-based and virtualized resources. As of April 2023, it covers more than 76,000 Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. Tenable Research, the cybersecurity research arm of Nessus' manufacturer, maintains and continually updates a library of more than 185,000 plugins that can be used to augment the platform. Plugins contain scripts to identify, remediate and test for the presence of specific vulnerabilities. Tenable releases about 100 new plugins weekly and within 24 hours of vulnerability disclosure. Plugins can be downloaded through the Nessus interface or a web-based catalog.
 
Nessus provides more than 450 pre-configured templates for commonly used vulnerability scans and configuration audits to simplify use of the platform. For example, the Audit Cloud Infrastructure template can be used to audit the configuration of Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, Rackspace, Salesforce and Zoom. The interface is easy to navigate and provides a simple set of remediation actions to fix the vulnerabilities and protect the affected system. Teams can also audit configuration compliance against Center for Internet Security benchmarks and other best practices.
 
Another benefit of Nessus is that it has a low false-positive rate of 0.32 defects per 1 million scans. Too many false positives can overwhelm security teams and lead to alert fatigue, causing legitimate threats to be overlooked.
 
Finally, Nessus is a highly portable vulnerability scanner, making it a useful tool for security professionals who are required to move between locations. Examples include penetration testers and security consultants.
 
Nessus is available in two enterprise versions: Professional and Expert. Both offer unlimited IP address scanning and other key features, such as access to an extensive plugin database. Nessus Expert offers a few additional features for organizations with more advanced needs.
 
The Professional version is ideal for security consultants, security practitioners and pen testers looking for a tool that provides unlimited point-in-time assessments, configurable assessments and live results. This tool can be used anywhere and provides configurable reports that can be used by security teams to understand vulnerabilities and address them.
 
Nessus Expert fills in these gaps and provides greater breadth and depth of coverage into the enterprise attack surface. Expert includes everything in the Professional version and additional features to address risks outside of traditional IT assets. It does this by assessing all infrastructure-as-code repositories for vulnerabilities before they are pushed to production and by discovering internet-exposed IT assets, including cloud services.
 
Both versions of Nessus evaluate the severity of various threats using Tenable's VPR tool, a component of Nessus' Predictive Prioritization feature. VPR assigns a score to each finding, based on its potential threat and impact, to identify the vulnerabilities that pose the greatest risk to an organization's IT and internet-facing environments. The goal of VPR is to help IT teams prioritize the vulnerabilities most in need of immediate remediation.
 
Nessus generates VPR scores after analyzing various sources of raw data -- including threat intelligence feeds, exploit repositories and security advisories -- using machine learning models and comparing that result with the Common Vulnerability Scoring System framework.
 
An OpenVAS vs. Nessus comparison is a battle between two top leaders in the vulnerability scanning market. Each tool has its strengths and weaknesses, but deciding between them will likely come down to your specific use case. Nessus is best for companies that want more of an off-the-shelf vulnerability scanning solution, while the open source OpenVAS is best for organizations that want more customization and integrations.
 
Open Vulnerability Assessment System (OpenVAS) and Nessus both function in a similar fashion. After discovering points of weakness, the scanners compare them against a database of known vulnerabilities, identify and rank the discovered security gaps (usually in a summarized report) by severity or risk score, and offer advice or actions to take toward remediation.
 
Vulnerability scanners comprise a diverse and divergent set of solutions, from tools for software penetration testing (pentesting) to suites that identify and classify IT infrastructure weak points, quantify related cyber risks, and prescribe mitigation strategies and activities to close the discovered security gaps.
 
Both OpenVAS and Nessus fall into that second category: tools that discover weak points in networked environments like firewalls, applications, and services before cyber attackers seize the opportunity to compromise exposed IT assets. By systematically probing for weaknesses and security flaws, these vulnerability scanners can identify, classify, and enumerate exploitable targets like open ports, services, software versions, and more to help security professionals correct them in an ongoing, timely manner.
 
It uses a client-server architecture consisting of two main components: the OpenVAS Scanner and the OpenVAS Manager. The OpenVAS Scanner performs the actual vulnerability scanning tasks. OpenVAS Manager orchestrates and manages the scanning process, including scheduling scans, collecting results, and generating reports.
 
When a vulnerability scan is initiated, OpenVAS Manager communicates with the OpenVAS Scanner to execute the scan according to configured parameters. The scanner systematically probes the target systems or networks, identifying potential vulnerabilities by actively testing for known security issues.
 
Finally, the OpenVAS Manager aggregates the results, prioritizes vulnerabilities based on severity and potential impact, and generates detailed reports that provide actionable insights for remediation efforts, empowering organizations to proactively manage and mitigate security risks.
 
Though once available as a free, open source download, the no-cost version of Nessus is primarily available these days as Tenable Nessus Essentials, a scaled down version of the leading vulnerability scanner. Nessus Essentials allows users to scan environments up to 16 IP addresses per scanner, max.
 
During the scanning process, Nessus employs a variety of techniques to identify vulnerabilities, including network scanning, port scanning, service enumeration, and vulnerability checks based on extensive plugins. These plugins contain checks for thousands of known vulnerabilities across diverse platforms and applications.
 
As the scan progresses, Nessus collects detailed information about discovered vulnerabilities, prioritizing them based on severity and potential impact. Upon completing the scan, Nessus generates comprehensive reports that provide actionable insights into the security posture of the scanned environment, enabling organizations to proactively address weaknesses and mitigate security risks effectively.
 
While both solutions gained their popularity in open source form, their maintainers are decidedly commercial in nature. Greenbone Networks AG, the developer of the full-featured OpenVAS vulnerabi
