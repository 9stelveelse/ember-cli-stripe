**I.2**When you exude confidence, it becomes contagious. This confidence helps your subjects feel more comfortable throughout the process. Insecurity often becomes apparent in a pose or expression. Here, you can feel the subject beaming her confidence.
 
We will also explore the most common posing problems and mistakes that can ruin an otherwise great pose. We will train ourselves to identify problem areas before we click the shutter and make subtle changes that result in drastically more successful images. Together we will explore tips for posing the body, face, and hands for successful results.

My hope is that this book will become your go-to resource for navigating the challenging world of posing and photographing a wide range of subjects, while helping you to build the foundations of posing that give you the confidence you need to create compelling portraiture.
 
**I.3**Boudoir photography is all about creating and flattering curves. We will talk about several techniques for creating curves, including narrowing points (a pose that purposefully narrows at the bottom of the frame).
 
For them, pose is a four-letter word. They associate posing with stiff body positions and uncomfortable expressions. Candids are informal images, typically taken without the subject knowing they are being photographed. People often associate candids with relaxed, natural expressions.
 
Every single subject that steps in front of your camera is beautiful. Every single one. Your job is to help the subject appreciate his or her beauty. Having a portrait taken can be a vulnerable experience that requires a great deal of trust. Your job is to see and showcase their beauty, and to use all the tools available to you as a photographer to do so.
 
Go-to poses and guidelines give you a great place to start, but your photographic expertise can allow you to make appropriate changes to help an individual really shine. In this book, we will cover the posing and perspective tools available for you to control exactly how your camera represents your subject (**FIGURE I.5).**
 
**I.5**This curvy subject wanted to be bold and try a bodysuit fashion shot for her image. The light, pose, and her expression all work together to communicate her confidence and strength.
 
As with all aspects of photography, rules are meant to be broken. I will teach you many rules of posing that will help build a better understanding of how to flatter your subjects. That being said, these guidelines are meant to be a strong foundation and not intended to constrain you (**FIGURE I.6).**

**I.7**While this shot was very successful, there were other images in which the hips were misplaced, the hand awkward, or the expression ill-fitting. By training my eye, I can now catch these common mistakes while they are happening and improve them to get the results that bring out the best in my subject.

One of the biggest obstacles that photographers face with posing is understanding how their camera sees. You may have a beautiful pose that flatters your subject, but the lens, direction, and camera angle you have chosen may prove to be unflattering. Similarly, a pose may look somewhat unnatural to the naked eye, yet because of your camera angle and lens choice, the shot comes out stunning!
 
Posing is not a stand-alone aspect of photography. It works in conjunction with perspective and how your camera sees and interprets your subject. In fact, these elements are inextricable. For that reason, we need to take some time to truly understand this intertwining of tools.
 
This will become an infinitely powerful concept as you seek to make certain parts of the body appear larger or more emphasized, while making other parts of the body appear smaller or with less visual emphasis.
 
The next piece of the equation of perspective is lens choice. Yes, whatever is closest to the camera looks larger. Yes, whatever is farther from the camera looks smaller. However, the focal length you choose will serve to make this effect either subtler or more exaggerated.
 
Think of it like this: You are photographing a mountain with a tree in the foreground. If you use a wide-angle lens, the tree looks very far away from the mountain, but looks larger in comparison because it is closer. If you use a long lens, the tree looks much closer to that mountain, and more correctly proportioned. Focal length changes appearance of distance.
 
**CAUTION**When shooting groups and families, a wider focal length that exaggerates distance can become a problem, causing the group to look separated by distance, and introducing issues with distortion.
 
With a wide focal length (24mm), the distance between the hand and face is exaggerated. This also results in the hand looking much larger (whatever is closer to the camera appears larger). With the longer lens (135mm), distance is compressed. Even though the hand is closer to the camera, it looks virtually unchanged by perspective (it looks the same as if the hand were back by the face).
 
As you shoot, you should always remember this essential technique that will allow you to draw attention to and away from certain areas of the body. When you want more attention on a body part or for it to appear larger, bring it closer to the camera. When you want less attention on a body part or want it to appear smaller, push it away from the camera. This is true whether the subject is sitting, standing, in shorts, wearing a dress, or is male or female. Perspective will make a huge difference.
