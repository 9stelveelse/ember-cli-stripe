This widget provides an out-of-the-box editing experience to help streamline editing within a web application. It automatically recognizes if there are editable feature layers within the map. The layers that are editable will automatically be used by the widget. It is possible to configure how the Editor behaves by setting itslayerInfos property.This property takes an array of objects which allows configuring the the editing experience for these layers.

Note that the update operations (such as rotate, move, and transform) happen in the map space.This means that, for example in 3D, if a graphic is rotated in a global WGS84 view, its shape and segment lengths change.
 
The following model formats are currently supported. For additional information, please refer to the ArcGIS Pro documentation.Please note that only one model can be uploaded at a time and zip files should be used for a model with additional texture files.
 
Snapping can be configured using the controls in the Editor widget's "Settings" menu. By default,snapping is disabled. Toggle "Enable snapping" to enable it. By default, both geometry guidesand feature-to-feature snapping are enabled.
 
Geometry guides allow the editor to specify howthey want their geometries to be drawn. For example, when the segment being drawn is nearlyperpendicular to another segment, the cursor may snap to form a precise right angle.
 
Feature-to-feature snapping allows new or existing geometries to be snapped to other geometries,including those in other layers, as shown within the "Snapping layer" list. By default, all layersthat can be configured for snapping are shown in this list. The available layers can be restrictedby updating the Editor's snappingOptions bysetting the FeatureSnappingLayerSource directly.
 
The tooltips provide useful information about a feature or its components (vertices and segments) thatare being drawn or edited. For example, they show the position of vertices, the direction and distanceof segments, as well as orientation and scale of meshes.
 
Coordinate inputs and editing constraints are helpful to achieve greater control while drawing features.Press Tab to activate the input mode while drawing a new feature, or when editing a point, mesh, or a selected vertex.
 
It is possible to edit related data via the Editor widget. The relationship element provides the functionality needed to configure the relationship within the formTemplate. These elements must be saved within the form for the Editor to support editing related data. This can be accomplished via the Map Viewer's authoring experience or programmatically using the SDK.
 
Once the form is authored, the Editor automatically checks if there is a formTemplate set on the editable layer, or the widget's corresponding layerInfo. If the form's template is not set or is not configured to contain relationship elements, the Editor will not display the option to edit the relationship data. Additional considerations when using the Editor to edit related data are provided below.
 
Authenticated users that are layer owners, administrators or users with full editing privileges will have their elevated user privileges applied in regards to editing behavior and data access. This mimics the behavior available in Map Viewer. To opt out, set esriConfig.userPrivilegesApplied to false.
 
Indicates the heading level to use for title of the widget. By default, the title (i.e. "Editor") is renderedas a level 4 heading (e.g. Editor). Depending on the widget's placementin your app, you may need to adjust this heading for proper semantics. This isimportant for meeting accessibility standards.
 
The SnappingOptions for editing. Supports self snapping and feature snapping. Starting with version 4.23, the SnappingControls UI is automatically integrated into the Editor widget.Modify the snappingOptions if modifications are needed from what is provided in the default UI.
 
This property is useful for basic overrides of the default widgets. There may be some limitationsto what the Editor can do with these overridden properties. For example, the Editor will disable the multipleSelectionEnabled property in Sketch.defaultUpdateOptionsno matter what is set within this property.
 
The view model for this widget. This is a class that contains all the logic(properties and methods) that controls this widget's behavior. See theEditorViewModel class to accessall properties and methods on the widget.
 
If false, the widget will no longer be rendered in the web document. This may affect the layout of other elements or widgets in the document. For example, if this widget is the first of three widgets associated to the upper right hand corner of the view UI, then the other widgets will reposition when this widget is made invisible.For more information, refer to the css display value of "none".
 
Key identifying the group to which the handles should be added. All the handles in the groupcan later be removed with Accessor.removeHandles().If no key is provided the handles are added to a default group.
 
when() may be leveraged once an instance of the class is created. This method takes two input parameters: a callback function and an errback function.The callback executes when the instance of the class loads. Theerrback executes if the instance of the class fails to load.
 
(Since 4.26) Indicates whether to enable or disable attachments while creating features. Support for this is dependent upon whether this operation is supported on the FeatureLayer.capabilities.operations.
 
(Since 4.26) Indicates whether to enable or disable attachments while updating existing features. Support for this is dependent upon whether update or delete operations are supported on the FeatureLayer.capabilities.
 
The Editor will not display attachment file names if it is displaying image types. These images must have resize support within its corresponding FeatureLayer, ie. FeatureLayer.capabilities.attachment.supportsResize is true. Attachment types, other than images, will display an icon and its corresponding file name.
 
Set this to customize any supporting Editor widget's default behavior. Specific properties can be adjusted in the Attachments, FeatureForm, and FeatureTemplates widgets. In addition, it is possible to update specific properties within the SketchViewModel.
 
It is recommended to set Editor.snappingOptions.enabled = true if enabledToggle is set to false.This is because selfEnabledToggle and featureEnabledToggle require snapping globally to be enabled in order to be interactive. Otherwise, these toggles will not be responsive.
 
Indicates if the update operation was aborted. Returns true if the user pressed the esc key, or when the update(), create()or cancel() method is called before the update event's state changes to complete.
 
Update operation tool info.Returns additional information associated with the update operation that is taking place for selected featureand what stage it is at. Value of this parameter changes to null when the update event's state changes to complete.
 
For example, use a custom editor to change the appearance of the script in the Inspector.

You can attach the Editor to a custom component by using the CustomEditor attribute.

There are multiple ways to design custom Editors.If you want the Editor to support multi-object editing, you can use the CanEditMultipleObjects attribute.Instead of modifying script variables directly, it's advantageous to use the SerializedObject and SerializedPropertysystem to edit them, since this automatically handles multi-object editing, undo, and Prefab overrides. If this approach is used a user can select multiple assets in the hierarchy window and change the values for all of them at once.

You can either use UIElements to build your custom UI or you can use IMGUI. To create a custom inspector using UIElements, you have to override the Editor.CreateInspectorGUI on the Editor class. To create a custom inspector using IMGUI, you have to override the Editor.OnInspectorGUI on the Editor class. If you use UIElements and have Editor.CreateInspectorGUI overwritten, any existing IMGUI implementation using Editor.OnInspectorGUI on the same Editor will be ignored.

Here's an example of a custom inspector:

The following example defines the layout of a custom inspector in uxml. The definition loads as a resource and the VisualTreeAsset.CloneTree method puts the hierarchy in a VisualE
