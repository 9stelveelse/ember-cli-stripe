Along with the original owner, Mr. Hong, Ha-rim, Seon-ki, and Min-yub gossip, tease, argue, and pout while they become more like family than coworkers. They complain about love, customers, their cranky boss and each other, as they serve cup after cup of coffee and plates of waffles. Their banter lends an authenticity to the coffee house that serves as the backdrop of the drama. Together, they make the coffee house an interesting place to hang out.
 
What I loved about this show was the sensitivity with which it treated Han Gyul's growing attraction to another 'man'. This is perfectly encapsulated by his reaction to the revelation that Eun Chan is not, in fact, male. Han Gyul feels hurt, anger and betrayal - because he suffered so much and fought so hard to understand and accept what he was feeling and how he could feel this way towards a man - before coming to (happy) terms with the realisation.

The way the show handled Han Gyul's growing attraction was also my favorite part of the show. It wasn't done as a fan service or played off for comedy purposes the way Korean dramas do so often. But done in a way that was brutally beautiful in its implementation. HG initial confusion, his devastation later on at realizing his attraction to EC, and his final painful acceptance was portrayed by GY with so much sensitivity and vulnerability that I bought into his pain. That scene on the beach where he lets himself mold his body against GY's silhouette (not quite touching but so close) and cries with the pain of it all, just kills me every time. His pain makes the gender reveal feel that much more like betrayal because of how much it took from him to accept her as a man. It also forever cemented my love for GY as an actor, and this drama as an all time favorite.
 
Another scene that I love takes place on his rooftop patio. Han-gyul is sitting with his back to Eun-chan, who is seated on a wall or the back of a bench that's beyond reach of him. He's talking about something painful, and she stretches out her arms as if to enfathom him in a comforting back hug -- but doesn't dare touch him. Her longing in that gesture was exquisite.
 
Thanks for this post @teriyaki. Coffee Prince has been my all time favorite drama, so much so that I rewatched it over and over again! I loved and still love this pair - Han Gyul and Eun Chan. The cast and characters were great, the camaraderie between the princes was great the coffee shop. The supporting cast and characters were great, especially the ajhussi and ajhummas. Only character I disliked was Yoo Jo for her pendulum mind, switching boyfriends and displaying zero loyalty and then expecting 200 times more loyalty from others.
 
The actors did a great job and there were explosive reactions, disagreements and more. I rarely download dramas, but this was the first drama I loved so much that I ended up downloading as I went back to watch it again and again!
 
We are so unconsciously "programmed" to accept roles and behaviours. Even beanies who watch countless shows where the male lead behaves pretty much exactly as Yoo Joo find it hard to appreciate when a female character behaves that way.
 
Even the comments are illuminating. A male lead who left his "girl" to pursue his dreams as an artist would be considered brave and ambitious, but the comments here call "her" flighty and a pendulum mind.

Multiple male leads who have previous girlfriends etc are still desirable and swoon worthy when the finally find their "true love" in the steady, reliable and sweet heroine. But Yoo Joo is somehow unworthy because she chooses to explore relationships on her own terms.
 
I actually liked her too because she sometimes became the voice of comfort to Eun-chan with her little stories. And that time when Han-gyul was unsure of how to make up with Eun-chan. Yoo-joo did have issues of her own but I was relieved that I didn't have to worry about her when it came to the Han-gyul.
 
Aww Coffee Prince. Definitely in my top favorites of all time. A true classic (and it's recently been released on Blu-ray in Korea after 10 years!) I am currently re-watching (for the nth time) this with my sister who is watching it for the first time despite her love for Gong Yoo (shocking! but better late than never). And she is going gaga over it. Haha!
 
I watched this when it came out and I was young then. I did not fully understand the complicated relationships and had little appreciation for the themes bravely tackled by the show considering it was in an era when those themes were controversial or taboo. After having watched it now that I am older, it felt both familiar and new. It felt new because I was able to have deeper understanding of the characters and their choices. The themes surrounding gender and sex were handled with sensitivity without glossing over them. The drama and the character just truly feel real to me.
 
I remember enjoying this drama but I didn't know what to make of it. When I just rewatched Coffee Prince a few weeks ago, I definitely appreciate it more the second time around. This drama does not feel dated and the story is just as relatable today as it was in 2007.
 
It does not feel dated at all. When I decided to re-watch it for the first time I was dreading how it will look in modern-day and how I would feel about the fashion and the overall look, but it's not bad at all. The fashion isn't much an indicative of it's time than I expected. I have seen worse. Haha! Even the OST was not the dramatic kind common during that era when there's like 3-5 songs played over and over. The songs here are rather low-key and chill.
 
Coffee Prince, hmm.... many things were way annoying and I didnt understand what was likable about this or that. I mostly liked the old coffee house master and granny. Favorite scene: smelly socks in that back room and Eun Chan chatting with Granny (was it having ice cream? cant remember). Han Gyuls relationship with granny was the best part, but in general he seemed a bit stupid. all the other guys, excluding Master, didnt like them. well, ok Kim Jae Wooks pancake guy was ok, a no-nonsense type.
 
The fact that he's the most good looking leading man. You know he's older, but your mind tricked and convinced you that he still look as hot as he were in 2007, and it's true. 27 or 37 y/o, Gong Yoo will always look gorgeous at any age.
 
Where is that damb fountain of youth? Lol His fanbases actually make memes of his face from years ago and now. Same face. Same smile. Haha! Thing is, it's obvious that he changed because of course he aged, but at the same time, he did not change at all. Haha Am I makimg sense? Anyway, I do think he grew more handsome and manly as the years passed. He aged like fine wine.
 
I can never get over my love for coffee prince. I've re-watched it numerous times and it still pulls at my heart. I love the very down-to-earth directing the show has throughout despite the high emotions towards the middle/end. There is always a sense that this story is grounded and that makes it so much easier to immerse yourself in it.
 
She was really into her character as a girl who look like a boy. In the first few 15-20 minutes of episode 1, I would not sure that she's a girl if I muted the sound and didn't read the subs.
My first thought when I watched go eun chan was hillary swank in Boys Dont Cry. But CP was also one of my first korean dramas. I was still very amazed how good the quality of k-dramas compare to other asian countries' productions, so I might be a little bit biased.
 
I seem to recall reading somewhere that Yoon Eun-hye studied male gaits so she could literally "Walk Like a Man" (tip of the hat to Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons). Owing to differences in the pelvic bones and the angles of the hip joints, men and women walk differently. I thought it was cool that she prepared for her role as Eun-chan by paying such careful attention to the biomechanics of bipedal locomotion. ;-)
 
Yes, that and her apology seemed very standoffish since she looked like she was doing a CF for her bag when she was trying to apologize for the plagiarism issue. With all that happening one after the other, I don't think she will be accepted in dramas anytime soon. :(
 
Not really. She still gets many offers but she's into her religion more these days. She prefers doing religious activity rather than taking acting project. For her doing what she loves the most (religion) is more important than acting, which makes her loyal fans heartbrokened. She said that she has had to turned down some offers because it "clashed" with her religious activity abroad. She said this on one of her confession on religious event in Indonesia. You can watch it on YouTube.
 
I so love the soundtrack (both official and unofficial). The drama used mostly indie, chill music. The kind you will want to listen to while on a drive. And I totally forgot that they used English songs too. They all fit the scenes.
 
Some of my faves songs are Azura Ray- Across the Ocean, Adult Child- Star, As One- White Love Story, Bluedawn- Last Arpeggios... I hunted down every single song and music played in the show. I recall JB making a list of all official and unofficial songs. Now I want to take a listen. Hehe
 
I loved Coffee Prince:
The story, the romance, the companionship, the relationships in Han Gyul's family, and the list keeps going on. One of the best k-dramas ever and it stands out because it manages to be different while being mainstream.
 
I don't know how this is so timely because even though Coffee Prince reminds me of my old kdrama watching days, it also reminds me of Lee Eon's lost. He played the gruff but good-na
