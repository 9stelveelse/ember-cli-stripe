A **mix** variance is used to monitor the cost of material. Forinstance, if more of an expensive material has been used and less of acheap material, then the cost will be higher - and the variance adverse.
 
(4) In the 'difference' column, work line byline and find the difference between the AQSM and the AQAM. The total ofthe difference should be equal to 0. In the last column, multiply thedifference by the standard price to get the mix variance.

A **yield** variance measures the efficiency of turning theinputs into outputs. If the yield variance is adverse, it suggests thatactual input is lower than the expected output. This could be due tolabour inefficiencies, higher waste, inferior materials, or using acheaper mix with a lower yield.
 
A company produces pre-cast concrete sections for the constructionindustry. The mix of materials used to produce the concrete can bevaried and different mixes are suitable for different products. Discussthe issues that management should consider when setting standardmaterial costs.
 
It may be the case that, whilst changing a material mix could leadto an overall favourable material variance this could have an adverseimpact on the profitability of the business if prices have to be reducedbecause of reduced quality or quality failure costs exceed materialcost savings. Thus it is important to set the standard mix at the levelwhich optimises profit taking all factors into consideration.
 
(1) **Sales price variances** are calculated by comparing theactual selling price per unit and the budgeted selling price per unit;each price variance is multiplied by the number of units for each typeof product.
 
(2) A **sales volume variance** is the difference between theactual number of units sold, and the budgeted number. Each difference ismultiplied by the budgeted profit per unit. Sales volume in turnssplits into a **sales mix variance** and a **sales quantity variance**.

(4) A **sales quantity variance** indicatesthe effect on profit of selling a different total quantity from thebudgeted total quantity. Like the mix variance, it can be calculated inone of two ways :
 
Budgeted fixed production overhead for the last period was $81,000.This was absorbed on a machine hour basis. The standard machine hoursfor each product and the budgeted levels of production and sales foreach product for the last period are as follows :
 
The standard is set as part of the budgeting process which occursbefore the period to which it relates. This means that the differencebetween standard and actual may arise partly due to an unrealisticbudget and not solely due to operational factors. The budget may need tobe revised to enable actual performance to be compared with a standardthat reflects these changed conditions.
 
Hudson has a sales budget of 400,000 units for the coming yearbased on 20% of the total market. On each unit, Hudson makes a profit of$3. Actual sales for the year were 450,000, but industry reports showedthat the total market volume had been 2.2 million.
 
When applying planning and operating principles to cost variances(material and labour), care must be taken over flexing the budgets. Theaccepted approach for use in the exam is to flex both the original andrevised budgets to actual production levels:
 
Rhodes Co manufactures Stops which it is estimated require 2 kg ofmaterial XYZ at $10/kg In week 21 only 250 Stops were produced althoughbudgeted production was 300. 450 kg of XYZ were purchased and used inthe week at a total cost of $5,100. Later it was found that the standardhad failed to allow for a 10% price increase throughout the materialsupplier's industry. Rhodes Ltd carries no stocks.
 
A transport business makes a particular journey regularly, and hasestablished that the standard fuel cost for each journey is 20 litres offuel at $2 per litre. New legislation has forced a change in thevehicle used for the journey and an unexpected rise in fuel costs. It isdecided retrospectively that the standard cost per journey should havebeen 18 litres at $2.50 per litre.
 
The standard cost per unit of raw material was estimated to be$5.20 per unit. However, due to subsequent improvements in technology,the general market price at the time of purchase was $5.00 per unit. Theactual price paid was $5.18 per unit. 10,000 units of the raw materialswere purchased during the period.
 
The standard hours per unit of production for a product is 5 hours.Actual production for the period was 250 units and actual hours workedwere 1,450 hours. The standard rate per hour was $10. Because of ashortage of skilled labour it has been necessary to use unskilled labourand it is estimated that this will increase the time taken by 20%.
 
(1) At the commencement of period 3 the normalmaterial became unobtainable and it was necessary to use an alternative.Unfortunately, 0.5 kg. per unit extra was required and it was thoughtthat the material would be more difficult to work with. The price of thealternative was expected to be $16.50 per kg. In the event, actualusage was 12,450 kg at $18 per kg
 
(2) Weather conditions unexpectedly improvedfor the period with the result that a 50c per hour bad weather bonus,which had been allowed for in the original standard, did not have to bepaid. Because of the difficulties expected with the alternativematerial, management agreed to pay the workers $8 per hour for period 3only. During the period 18,800 hours were paid for.
 
There must be a good reason for deciding that the original standardcost is unrealistic. Deciding in retrospect that expected costs shouldbe different from the standard should not be an arbitrary decision,aimed perhaps at shifting the blame for bad results due to pooroperational management or poor cost estimation.
 
A company is operating in a fast changing environment and isconsidering whether analysing existing variances into a planning andoperational element would help to improve performance. Discuss theadvantages and disadvantages of the approach.
 
Standard product costs apply to manufacturing environments in whichquantities of an identical product are output from the productionprocess. They are not suitable for manufacturing environments whereproducts are non-standard or are customised to customer specifications.
 
Shorter product life cycles in the modern business environment meanthat standard costs will need to be reviewed and updated frequently.This will increase the cost of operating a standard cost system but, ifthe standards are not updated regularly, they will be of limited use forplanning and control purposes. The extra work involved in maintainingup-to-date standards might limit the usefulness and relevance of astandard costing system.
 
It is doubtful whether standard costing is of much value forperformance setting and control in automated manufacturing environments.There is an underlying assumption in standard costing that control canbe exercised by concentrating on the efficiency of the workforce. Directlabour efficiency standards are seen as a key to management control.However, in practice, where manufacturing systems are highly automated,the rates of production output and materials consumption, are controlledby the machinery rather than the workforce.
 
Variances are the difference between actual performance andstandard, measured in cost terms. The significance of variances formanagement control purposes depends on the type of standard cost used.JIT and TQM businesses often implement an ideal standard due to theemphasis on continuous improvement and high quality. Therefore, adversevariances with an ideal standard have a different meaning from adversevariances calculated with a current standard.
 
Variance analysis is often carried out on an aggregate basis (totalmaterial usage variance, total labour efficiency variance and so on)but in a complex and constantly changing business environment moredetailed information is required for effective management control.
 
In a performance measurement system managers are often rewarded forimproving the performance of cost and/or revenues under their control.The production manager may be responsible for the material mix decisionand, if the reward system is based on achieving cost savings, then thecheapest mix may be used. This may have a detrimental effect on companyprofit if quality is reduced and this leads to a lower price or qualityfailure costs.
 
(c) It could be argued that the increasedcompetition in the market was not foreseen when the budget was set andthe variance is thus a planning variance. However, this line ofreasoning would suggest that any unforeseen issues give rise just toplanning variances. Perhaps sales managers should have identifiedpotential threats sooner? Also, once extra competition was experienced,managers had to decide how to respond. This could have involvedadditional advertising rather than price cuts, e.g. it could be arguedthat price cuts were made to try (unsuccessfully) to protect marketshare, in which case managers should be held (at least partly)responsible for such a decision.
 
Operational variance: The cost per unit was higher than therevised budgeted cost resulting in the adverse variance. This varianceis controllable by management and should be linked to their performanceevaluation
 
(c) The analysis of variances in part (b) makesit possible to separate those variances which are non-controllable (theplanning variances) from the variances which are controllable by theindividual managers (the operational variances) .In this case the changein type of material used was unavoidable. Similarly, the change inweather conditions could not have been anticipated.
 
Standard costing is most suited to organisations whose activitiesconsist of a series of common or repetitive operations. Typically, massproduction ma
