Or am I missing something here?I have added aria-labelledby, aria-describedby and role to the dialog.
 
**Voice Dialogue**, a modality in which therapists address specific parts of a person's psyche by engaging those parts in dialogue, can foster healing by allowing people in treatment to delve into their psyche in a safe environment. This non-pathological approach, often used in conjunction with other forms of therapy, aims to uncover what is present, not what is "wrong" or missing.

Individuals seeking therapy to help address conflicting thoughts, emotions, or values, especially those experienced when making life decisions, may find Voice Dialogue to be helpful. Participants in Voice Dialogue may develop a more balanced awareness of the self and greater self-awareness. They may also experience improvement in their personal relationships and become better able to express themselves freely.
 
Voice Dialogue is intended to help those in therapy determine the parts of the psyche they most identify with and help them discover how to separate themselves from the psyche in order to reduce and/or eliminate any negative effects it might have. Voice Dialogue therapists (facilitators) aim to help people in therapy to increase knowledge and awareness of the inner selves.
 
During a typical session, the facilitator will invite the many selves of the person in therapy to speak about what life is like for that self. The role of the facilitator is to listen and encourage the selves to provide as much information as they can about their views. They do not attempt to negotiate between selves, change the selves, or encourage them to agree on something. The facilitator may ask questions as part of this process in an attempt for both the person in therapy and the facilitator to learn more about each self. Questions might include:
 
To promote the expression and understanding of the individual selves, each self is given its own chair or space in the room. The facilitator will encourage the person in therapy to move from one chair to the next as each different self speaks. The Aware Ego process is also assigned its own chair so the person in treatment can observe, analyze, and act on what was revealed. After the presenting selves have spoken, the person in therapy stands next to the facilitator, who then gives an unbiased summary of what took place.
 
The Voice Dialogue approach is believed to help those in therapy increase self-knowledge, rediscover lost skills and talents, and communicate with their entire being. The Voice Dialogue approach is believed to help those in therapy increase self-knowledge, rediscover lost skills and talents, and communicate with their entire being. Instead of living in the manner encouraged by the primary selves, which may be habitual and/or reactive, individuals can often learn, through Voice Dialogue, how to develop a detached perspective. By doing so, people may not only become better able to make informed decisions in all areas of life, but might also gain insight on the many different aspects of self and how to balance them.
 
The heightened sense of awareness many experience is referred to as the Aware Ego or the Aware Ego process. This process helps those in therapy come to know all of the different layers of consciousness in order to gain greater insight and take care of the selves, in a manner that attempts to contain tension rather than appease one particular self.

A primary aim of this modality is to help those in treatment develop a greater sense of awareness and consciousness in order to experience an expanded ability to make choice-guided decisions rather than automatic, unconscious ones. This insight may be beneficial when individuals are faced with challenges and/or difficult life circumstances.
 
Voice Dialogue may be helpful to people who are experiencing communication issues, stress, certain mood-related concerns, and posttraumatic stress. This approach may be particularly successful in helping individuals work through relationship issues, whether these relationships are romantic, professional, or familial, by helping people address automatic relationship patterns that may be leading to difficulty.
 
The Voice Dialogue approach is not trademarked, so it does not belong exclusively to any one person or group. Additionally, the Stones do not certify people in the practice or support certification. Individuals interested in the practice or theory of the approach can arrange private tutorials with Sidra Stone at The Retreat at Thera in Mendocino County, California. Tutorials, which can be individual or conjoint, range from three to five sessions, each of which is between two and three hours long. Sessions may include explanations of bonding patterns, voice dialogue facilitations, exploration of the Aware Ego, or training in other areas as needed.
 
People who find guided imagery or self-awareness tasks to be challenging, and individuals who are coping with serious mental health concerns, such as schizophrenia, may have limited success with this approach.
 
While some therapists believe voice dialogue is an effective treatment approach, there is little empirical evidence to support this. The fact that no one is able to become certified in voice dialogue may be a possible consideration for some who are interesting in the approach.

Israel has quickly become one of the most polarizing forces in the North American Jewish community. In a world already much too divided, how can we approach the subject of Zionism without widening the rifts? This book wrestles with and attempts to frame the very fragile dialogue surrounding Zionism and Israel in the 21st century Progressive Jewish community. Written from a multiplicity of views, the collection explores the many lenses through which this varied community approaches Zionism, not only set apart by political differences but also by geographical diversity, religious divisiveness, socio-economic policies, gender issues, the use and abuse of power, and more. The Fragile Dialogue is a conversation starter, meant to provide a basis for narrowing the rifts in our dialogue around Zionism today.

I've been looking for a word to describe this tone of voice for a long time but never came across it. Now let me just spread a pinch of context. It's a first person novel, and our protagonist is very emotionally conflicted within. Dead parents, dead friends, blames himself etc. The only thing he has left is his younger companion who he cares for like an extremely over-protective older brother. Our protagonist is responsible (involuntarily responsible) for some earthquakes (long story), and his younger companion at this point in the novel questions if he himself was responsible for it.
 
OK. So the final bit of dialogue where the protagonist asks "Have you lost your mind," is actually the part I'm struggling with here. He does't actually yell. His voice is more like a throaty growl, as if to convey some frustration as well. Hearing this from Raaisel (younger companion) just turns his world upside down, because he would never allow his naive younger counterpart to step foot near the earthquake. Yeah, so instead of "I yelled," what the hell is that word. You ever watched the dark knight... where Batman goes to the joker "Where is she?" in that interrogation scene. Well it's a voice like that, but obviously with a bit less aggression. A brooding voice. God, what's the damn word?!
 
My first piece of advice would be to find a good example of what you want and describe it. You've found a good example with batman, but you're obvious
