The idea of a dual battery system is to have all (or most) of your accessories connected to the second battery (usually a deep cycle). As your accessories use power from the second battery the isolator prevents power from draining from your main starting battery leaving it ready for you to start your vehicle when needed. When you start your vehicle the isolator senses the charge from your alternator and links the 2 batteries together and charges them as you drive.

11-28 tooth, 7-geared freewheel paired with a Shimano derailleur and a thumb-triggered handlebar shifter allows you to swiftly change gears while riding to create pedaling efficiency and an easier riding experience at higher speeds.
 
Lectric's new Pedal Assist Wattage Regulation (PWR) Programming for the XPedition allows for an improved Pedal Assist experience by assisting the rider up to a certain power level for each PAS setting, instead of limiting the assistance by speed alone. Learn more about PWR here.
 
An external battery allows riders to charge the eBike without removing the battery. An additional battery can be added for increased range. Meanwhile, interchangeable spare batteries can be removed and installed in seconds, doubling your range.
 
An exclusive dual-leg kickstand located near the bottom bracket ensures the most balanced position for easy loading.\*\*\* Pushing forward allows you to start riding without having to manually put the kickstand up with precious cargo.
 
A US-based bicycle testing lab put the XPedition through the rigorous DIN standard testing process to prove the frame and fork can handle a 450lb maximum payload ride after ride. The XPedition is rated to DIN 79010:2020-02.5.9.5.2.
 
\* Where permitted by state law. \*\* Range can vary due to weight load, terrain, weather and other conditions. \*\*\* You MUST hold onto the Lectric XPedition whenever loading cargo and/or a passenger. The kickstand is not designed to be used for loading cargo. Do not assume the bike is stable and balanced when using the kickstand. Always hold onto the bike when cargo is being loaded, in place, or attached to the bike.

I would spend the money on this to make my setup more robust, but I am still curious, how exactly does your device protect the packs from high charge/discharge rates when unbalanced packs are connected in parallel? Does it limit the charge rate to something safe so the packs equalize over a longer period of time? Or does it cut the connection, or switch from one pack to the other?
Could you configure more than one of these to handle 4 or more packs in parallel?
 
@nperry, @adam It switches between batteries, discharging the higher voltage battery until they balance.
In theory I think you could connect four batteries into two circuit boards, then connect those two boards into a third one - let me test it and get back to you!
 
@adam, @nperry,@dtrail, we made a video showing how it works, and yes, you could connect 4 batteries into two controllers, then connect those two controllers into a third one that outputs to the system.

DuoRacer series is perfect for off-grid solar system such as motorhome, RVs, campers, boats, and so on. It charges the main battery (BATT1)for living, and supports trickle charging(max. 1A) to the start battery(BATT2) of vehicles at the same time.
 
It doesn't matter if both are 12V batteries. If both are 24V batteries, it is required to connect the Bat2 first and the Rated Voltage Level of Bat1 has to be set as 24V, or there will be System Voltage Error alarm.
 
Perfect for what i wanted; charging both the van & leisure battery. Agreed about the App, but when i e-mail Epever about it, they always respond quick and update the App ASAP; Samsung seem to always move the goal-posts ? I think i have lost connection twice in 2+ years, a few weeks each time.
 
Works well for me. Not so good english translation of the app Solar Guardian. And the app shows the sign for night (moon) in daytime and the sun in the despite the clock setting is correct. Software or hardware issue?
 
Hello sir, thank you for your suggestion and feedback about the solar guardian app. Since we are upgrading the app, could you please send some details about the issue to solarguardianfeedback@epever.com? This will help our R&D team better analyze and solve the issue. Thank you so much for your help.
 
Used for a maximum of 6 hours a week linked to my Garmin 520 Edge I get between 8 to 10 weeks before battery needs replacement. Garmin state up to 3.5 years before. Tried a whole range of 2032 batteries from Duracell to Kodak. Garmin have changed the HRM but no change. What's happening here ?????
 
After 12 months of use my HRM is also suffering from heavy battery usage. Had it for 2 years now and replaced 5 batteries. Not very happy and since you're not getting any response here I'll be looking for another brand for ANT+/BT combo.
 
This problem persists with Garmin offering no answers. The battery in HRM is being changed regularly. When not operating the HRM belt is not in communication with any device so why is it running down every 12 - 16 weeks ????
 
Having the same problem. The HRM DUAL has been a great device for a few years and batteries would last 12 or more months with regular use. Now in the past three months, batteries last 4-6 weeks. Is there a way to access the device to ensure its going to sleep?
 
tmk2 alluded to the problem (above) 2 years ago but didn't spell it out. The manual is similarly vague " To prolong the life of your heart rate monitor, unsnap the module when not in use." If you leave the device attached to the strap and roll the strap up for storage, the two chest contact patches can touch, and the device will keep transmitting. Just search for bluetooth devices using a phone or laptop a few minutes after taking it off - if it shows up it's not sleeping..
 
Thanks.....just about to replace another 2032 battery after 14 weeks. I do roll up the chest band so I will try your suggestion. However I recall a few years ago I used to unclip and it made no difference
 
Motobatt ensures you have the right solution to support additional accessories you add to your UTV, Harley, Boat or Vehicle. With AGM and Lithium batteries of the highest performance and Battery Isolators and cables both universal and Model Specific. supplier of the best motorcycle batteries, we supply a large range of AGM and lithium motorcycle batteries specially engineered and designed to power your activity. We are a global distributor of many other motorcycle hard parts and accessories that are designed to facilitate flexible installation whilst maintaining that OE fit that you are looking for. Check out our motorcycle battery chargers, testers or jump packs for your powersports as well.
 
There are many solar charge controllers on the market, but few that allow for concurrently charging two separate battery banks. I use this one to charge my lithium house battery bank and to simultaneously maintain my AGM chassis battery. It's a PWM controller which is not as efficient as MPPT, but in practice my battery banks have always maintained sufficient SOC. The compact size made it easier to find a good mounting location too.
 
Get another Canon charger, because I have never seen a dual one for LP-E6 series. There are for third-party chargers. I have a dual charger from Jupio. It just charges and doesn't reset the exposure count for the battery. 650 mA for one battery, 500 mA each for two batteries. Canon LC-E6 charges one battery with 1200 mA.
 
Prior to buying some 5 series bodies that use LP-E6 family batteries, I have always used Canon branded batteries and I will continue to do so with my 1 series bodies. But the LP-E6 Canon batteries do not display the quality and rock solid reliability of the LP-E19 (and previous LP-E4 and NP-E3) batteries for the 1 series gear. So I have been using aftermarket LP-E6NH batteries for my 5DS and 5DS R bodies for over a year now and unlike the Canon LP-E6 batteries I purchased earlier, none have failed unexpectedly and they are also far less expensive. I am happy to pay more for quality/reliability but in this specific case that wasn't the result.
 
The adapter plates have a high fiddle factor. They do not snap into place very well, or at least I have not managed to pull it off. I have seen other reviews report the same thing. The adapter keeps popping itself out of its socket. For some reason, all of the other adapter plates snap in place perfectly, just not the one for the LP-E6.
