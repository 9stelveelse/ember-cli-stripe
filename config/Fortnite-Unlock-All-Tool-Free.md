Sadly, there is currently no way to repair tools or weapons in LEGO Fortnite. With each strike, your weapon or tool loses a percentage of its durability. Once that bar reaches zero, your tool is gone forever. **You can check your tool's durability by looking at the green bar under the item icon in your inventory**.

Once a tool or weapon is gone, it's gone, unfortunately. The only way to get your hands on another one is to make it yourself. Items like wood and granite are very plentiful in every biome, so there should be plenty of ingredients around to craft yourself a Common Axe or Pickaxe in a pinch. Other more valuable tools, however, require more valuable items. These items can be difficult to find, but spending the time harvesting them is well worth it. Better tools allow you to harvest better resources.
 
If you've heard along the grapevine that you can repair tools in LEGO Fortnite, it is most likely due to a bug. You used to be able to repair tools by building a chest, placing damaged tools in it, destroying it, and picking them back up - fully repaired. That bug has since been patched, however, and that method no longer works.
 
You'll come across all kinds of rare materials and monsters when hunting for resources in **Lego Fortnite**. To harvest resources and survive against formidable enemies, you'll need all sorts of tools. Without crafting recipes to guide you, it can be a lengthy endeavor full of trial and error to create every tool.
 
To craft better tools, you'll also need to upgrade your crafting bench, which also requires a fair share of materials. With each crafting bench upgrade, the bench's rarity will increase, and more tools will become available for crafting. Here's everything you need to know about crafting better weapons and tools.
 
To craft every tool and weapon, **you'll need a Crafting Bench.** Upgrading your crafting bench is necessary for **creating tools of higher quality** and rarity. **Some weapons also require a Lumber Mill or Spinning Wheel**to discover and add their crafting recipe to your list.
 
**LEGO Fortnite** is a new imaginative survival crafting game mode in Fortnite, where players can adventure through different biomes to collect unique resources and fight wild creatures. To harvest and gather resources, players need different tools. The primary tools players have on hand as they explore the lands are **Pickaxe, Forest Axe, and Shovel.**
 
Upgrading tools is important for making progress in any survival game, and the same is the case with LEGO Fortnite. Better-quality tools are more efficient and enable players to harvest better resources. This guide comprises everything players need to know about upgrading their handy tools in LEGO Fortnite.

Upgrading the Crafting Bench to the Uncommon, Rare, or Epic tiers allows players to craft and upgrade tools of the respective tier. The table below contains a list of all the Crafting Bench upgrades along with their required materials in LEGO Fortnite.
 
**Harvesting Tools** (commonly referred as pickaxes) are items used in Battle Royale and Save the World to break structures and obtain wood, stone, and metal for building. They can also be used to damage other players; however, they are quite weak and only deal twenty damage per hit.
 
Season 9 also brought the introduction of Dual-Wielded Pickaxes, which are small harvesting tools with one held in each hand. The first Dual-Wielded harvesting tools were the Ripe Rippers and the Harmonic Axes.
 
Up until now, it was possible to use a glitch to repair them that involved placing your items in a chest and then breaking the chest. Unfortunately, that glitch now seems to have been patched, so you can no longer use it to keep your tools running, and people are now searching for another way to keep your tools alive.
 
You can place Crafting Benches on any surface that's flat enough, though we'd recommend placing your main ones inside Villages. Villagers will often make use of these to craft their own tools and weapon (this doesn't use up your resources).
 
This is done by interacting with it, then selecting the "bench upgrade" option at the top. Upgrades must be done for each individual Crafting Bench you have placed, but if you destroy an upgraded workbench you are refunded all materials used.
 
Rarities go in a set order: Common (Gray), Uncommon (Green), Rare (Blue), and Epic (Purple). Higher tier tools are always better than their lower tier counterparts, doing more damage against enemies or resources and having higher durability.
 
Once applied, these bonuses cannot be removed, and you can only add 3 essences to a single tool or weapon. You can stack multiple of the same type of essence on a single item, if you want to improve their effects.
 
One difference that the *Battle Royale* pickaxe has from *Save The World* is that players can purchase cosmetic pickaxes for it, making it look and sound different from the Default Pickaxe. These cosmetic pickaxes offer no-advantage (not-pay-to-win) in game play, same with weapons and outfits. Season 9 also has introduced Dual-wielded pickaxes or dual-wield, a pair of small harvesting tools that you swing one by one. As of Update 10.20, these cosmetic pickaxes can also be used in *Save The World*. Also, if you purchase *Save The World* as of now, you get the 7 different *Save The World* Pickaxes by upgrading your pickaxe in *Save The World*.
 
Pickaxes are generally available either through purchase with V-Bucks in the item shop or as a reward from achieving Tiers of the seasons of the Battle Pass. They can occasionally (very rarely) be obtained by challenges as well. Raider's Revenge was the first obtainable Pickaxe added to the game, outside of the base one, at Level 35 of the Season 1 Season Shop.
 
LEGO Fortnite doesn't provide a straightforward method to repair tools and weapons; usually, they just break after use. However, currently, there seems to be a glitch or bug that can restore them. Whether it's intentional or not, here's a workaround:
