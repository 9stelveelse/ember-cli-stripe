TASC will **directly contact** the small number of students with exam timetabling issues. Students with exam clashes and/or four back-to-back exams will automatically receive amended exam times. Students with three back-to-back exams will have the option of an amended timetable if they wish. Students with Reasonable Adjustments for more time and two same day exams will have the option of an amended exam start/finish time. Schools and students do not need to contact TASC to identify and have these issues resolved.
 
The Covid-19 pandemic has had a major impact on school leaving, university entrance and other high stakes exams around the world. Many northern hemisphere countries have exams around this time of year and have had to decide what action they will take. Major decisions have been taken to continue as planned, postpone, replace or cancel exams. Those who plan to keep to their original exam timetable or have introduced a short postponement may yet have to come up with an alternative action. Where exams have been cancelled, there will still be important technical and operational judgements to be made.
 
A. Cancel exams. Use completed exams and/or school based assessments to produce results.
B. Cancel exams and produce results using school and college generated estimates.
C. Replace planned exams with new on-line exams taken at home.
D. Postpone exams.
E. Press ahead with exams on schedule.

Normally examinations are scheduled for October/November but in 2021, they will be held in November/December. This is to allow teachers and candidates more time to finish the syllabus following the prolonged closure of schools from March 2020 to March 2021. However, teaching continued through TV, radio, print media and other online platforms.
Minor modifications will be effected on subjects with practical components.
 
The written examinations of the HKSDE 2021 will take place as scheduled from 23 April to 18 May. Since the pandemic has adversely affected teaching and learning at schools, one-off contingency measures are implemented to streamline the written examination and school-based assessment. In addition to adopting a wide range of precautionary measures at examination venues to safeguard the health of candidates and examination personnel, special examination arrangements are offered to candidates who need to undergo mandatory testing or quarantine.
 
Leaving Certificate Examination
(Examination at the end of upper secondary education; used for entry to further and higher education and employment; has three variants: LC established, LC vocational, and LC applied)
 
The administrations of the Psychometric Admission Test (PET) to higher education and the accompanying Language Proficiency Tests are to be scheduled as normal. All tests will be administered under restricted conditions published by the Ministry of Health.
 
Prolonged closure of schools led to the reduction of 25-30% syllabus to ensure that the academic content is manageable for schools. The examination has been postponed and will be held from July to give enough time to complete the syllabus. The examinations will consist of one-best multiple-choice questions (MCQs) only except for language examinations. The practical examinations have been replaced with alternate to practical examinations based on one-best MCQs.
 
The examinations are normally scheduled for May. There are some changes in implementation rules and guidance to accommodate health and safety during the pandemic. Minor test modifications will be introduced to allow better year over year comparison of the results.
 
The examinations are normally scheduled for October-November. At this stage, the intention is to go ahead as normal. There has been no trimming of the curriculum, while in some subjects there has been a reduction in the number of school-based assessment tasks. The supplementary examinations scheduled for May at this stage will go ahead as planned.
 
The central exams in the intermediate vocational education in the Netherlands (middelbaar beroepsonderwijs) proceed as usual. They have been prolonged with several weeks, so schools have more opportunities for planning sessions.
 
For the State Exams Dutch as a Second Language (Staatsexamens Nt2) CvTE has taken a number of measures, for instance regarding hygiene and to secure a 1,5 m distance. These exams are now also taken in evenings, so more sits can be organized.
 
All the testresults are being monitored thoroughly and if significant deviations are observed an adjustment in the standard will be considered. So far there has been no need to change the content of tests.
 
**AP:** Schools given choice of pencil and paper, digital, or combination depending on local contexts. Content coverage will back to 100% for 2021. All exam cancellation fees waived. Additional resources in AP Classroom include AP Daily videos and review sessions
 
**SAT:** Pencil and paper exams given worldwide, where local test centers determine that it safe to do so. Note that extra safety measures are in place, and precise measures differ at specific sites.
 
Administered by the Tasmanian Assessments, Standard and Certification body (TASC), the TCE is awarded to all Tasmanian students who have demonstrated a prescribed level of education and training standard as declared by TASC.
 
In order to be eligible for a TCE qualification award, students are required to meet the following TCE defined standards. Your school can help you plan a program of study for you to achieve the TCE. The TCE requirements can be met in different ways and in different settings:
 
The best way to achieve a good score in your TCE subjects is to seek help from your school teachers or from external mentors on how to maximise the available study resources. Their guidance and approach can help you devise a suitable study plan to meet the requirements under different methods and simulations
 
A combination of the above course types can help design your program of study to finally obtain the TASC Qualifications and Certificates which includes - Tasmanian Qualifications Certificate and Tasmanian Certificate of Education (TCE).
 
From 2022 onwards, five new senior secondary courses have been accredited by TASC as a part of the TCE curriculum. These courses include: Science, Transdisciplinary Science, Engineering Design, Civics and Citizenship, and Enterprise at Work.
 
The levels of complexity are assigned by TASC to describe how hard or demanding a course can be for students. The complexity level ranges from Level 1 - Level 4, and Levels 3 and 4 courses are the primary contributors to deriving your ATAR.
 
Levels 3 and 4 are designed to provide broad factual and practical knowledge as well as specialised skills to undertake further learning/employment opportunities. The courses specific to these levels of complexity prepare students to become self-guided learners who can apply their learned knowledge, judgement and autonomy to form logical decisions in the long-run.
 
Your high school is an exciting part of your school life as you close this part of your chapter to begin the journey of tertiary education into medicine or dentistry. It is important to be on top of your TASC course curriculum and to maximise on the available study resources as well as taking advice from your teachers or other reliable mentors with the right background knowledge.
 
But, most importantly, you have to take up initiative and familiarise yourself with the up-to-the-minute information on the TASC exam format, exam timetable and the marking scheme to receive your ATAR.
 
As you can see, ATAR is a crucial part of tertiary education admissions and in Tasmania, University of Tasmania (UTAS) is responsible for calculating the ATAR. To be eligible for an ATAR in Tasmania, you must complete two years of post-Year 10 studies and during these years, you must:
 
The TES is converted to derive your ATAR. Basically, the TES is a measure of your academic record in Years 11 and 12 and the higher your TE score, higher your ATAR as well. Remember that your ATAR will depend on how your TE score compares with the secured TE scores by your peers.
 
If you have any questions or doubts regarding the medical pathway after Year 12, our UCAT mentors are ready to lend a helping hand and can jump on a quick one-on-one chat at your convenience, free of charge.
