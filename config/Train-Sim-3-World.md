Further expansion and improvement of high-speed rail will continue. There are several high-profile projects that seem inevitable, despite facing hurdles, including California high-speed rail, the complicated history of high-speed rail in Australia, and perhaps most famously, the ever-delayed HS2 project in the UK.

Reportedly developed in response to Italo, a private high-speed rail operator in Italy, the ETR1000 trainsets carry 457 passengers in eight-car non-articulated 200-metre trains, with an engineered maximum speed of 400km/h.
 
In operation, the trains hit 300km/h but during testing in 2015 one of the ETR1000 sets reached 389km/h. 50 trainsets were built, but one is currently out of operation following the Livraga derailment.
 
On 6 February 2020, an ETR1000 operating the first service of the day was involved in a high-speed derailment at Livraga, on the Milan-Bologna high-speed line. The incident caused the death of the two train drivers and the injury of 31 people. It is the only railway accident to date on the Italian high-speed rail network.
 
The KTX-Sancheon is named after the Korean name of the indigenous fish cherry salmon. It has a top operational speed of 305km/h and is the first high-speed train designed and developed in South Korea.
 
Hyundai Rotem is currently manufacturing 16 sets of the latest commercial electrical multiple-unit model of the HEMU-430X, the EMU-320, expected to enter into service by the end of this year. In contrast to 316 seconds for the KTX-Sancheon, the EMU-320 can accelerate from 0 to 300km/h in 230 seconds and has a planned operation speed of 320km/h.
 
The Renfe Class 103 is a high-speed train that Spanish state-run operator Renfe uses for its AVE high-speed service. The trains, also known as Series 103 or S103, are manufactured by Siemens as part of the Velaro family.

Interestingly, the 8-car configuration that Renfe operates is actually two identical half-trains of four coaches. Each section has an independent power system, apart from the active pantograph and a high voltage line that runs along the length of the entire train.
 
12 Alstom Avelia Euroduplex (otherwise known as TGV 2n2f) trainsets run at speeds as high as 320km/h on the 323km dedicated high-speed track. Notably for a high-speed model, Euroduplex trains on the Al Boraq line are bi-level (double-decker), with a passenger capacity of 533. The trainsets are composed of two power cars and eight passenger cars.
 
The first Shinkansen trains to enter service in 1964, now classed as the 0 series, had a maximum operating speed was 220km/h. The current E5 and H5 Series, built by Hitachi Rail and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, hit a top operating speed of 320km/h.
 
The E5 series runs on Tohoku Shinkansen and Hokkaido Shinkansen services, and the H5 is a cold-weather derivative of the E5 series that runs on the same lines. H5 units include several cold-weather features, including an upgraded snowplough, more durable rubber protection on the connections between cars and a stainless-steel underframe that protects the electronics from the elements.
 
JR Central is developing an experimental Maglev Shinkansen, the L0 Series. Manufactured by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JR Central subsidiary Nippon Sharyo, the trains use the Japanese SCMaglev system.
 
JR Central plans to use the L0 series on the passenger services launching in 2027 on the Chūō Shinkansen railway line between Tokyo and Osaka. These trains are expected to operate at 500km/h but have hit a top speed during testing of a whopping 603km/h.
 
The SNCF TGV Network extends outside France, directly linking to Italy, Spain, Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany. Open-access operators also link France to other countries using TGV trainsets. TGV Lyria runs to Switzerland and Thalys/Eurostar to the UK, Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. Further afield, TGV trainsets operate in the US, Spain, Italy, Morocco, China and South Korea,
 
The ICE 3, or Intercity-Express 3, is a family of high-speed electric multiple-unit trains manufactured by Siemens and Bombardier. The ICE 3 is operated mainly by Deutsche Bahn (DB), but also by Dutch Railway operator Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS).
 
ICE 3 trains operate at the national maximum high-speed railways track speed of 320km/h in Germany, but have pipped their competition in this list due to the fact that the class 403 is authorised to run at speeds of 330km/h on the high-speed line between Frankfurt and Cologne to overcome delays. The ICE 3 Classes 403 and 406 hit top speeds of 368km/h on trial runs.
 
The China Railway (CR) Fuxing, also known as the CR series EMU, is a series of high-speed trains. Developed by China Railway Corporation, Fuxing trains operate at 350km/h but have been run as high as 420km/h in tests.
 
The China Railway (CR) Hexie, also known as the Harmony, is an umbrella term for the CRH series EMU high-speed trains. Although they operate at the same speed as the Fuxing trains, with a top operating speed of 350km/h, we have them in second place due to their higher record speeds in testing.
 
The CRH380A has the second-highest recorded speed of the Harmony trains, clocking 486.1km/h during a test run in 2010. Controversially, although it was not produced under a technology transfer agreement, there are accusations that the CRH380A is based on unlicensed Japanese Shinkansen technology.
 
Another notable Harmony model is the CRH380D, derived from the Bombardier Zefiro 380. With a record test speed of 483km/h, the highest speed ever recorded by a conventional unmodified high-speed train, there are 85 trainsets currently in operation in China, split across the Shanghai Railway and Chengdu Railway.
 
The service started commercial operations in April 2004 and runs on the 30.5km Shanghai Maglev Line. This is the first commercially operated high-speed magnetic levitation line, running from Longyang Road Station in Shanghai, China to Shanghai Pudong International Airport, the route is the first commercially operated high-speed magnetic levitation line.
 
HO Scale (1:87) is by far the most popular scale in the industry, featuring the widest variety of high quality trains and accessories. At half the size of O scale, HO scale trains can fit into smaller spaces and are the perfect size for most hobbyists whether you are just a beginner or a seasoned modeler. Popular manufacturers of HO scale trains include Athearn, Atlas, Bachmann, Intermountain, Walthers, and Rapido, among many more.
 
If you are interested in trains, you came to the right place. The great thing about this museum is that the exhibition is in 4 languages and so everyone can understand it and not only needs to look at the exhibits, but can also understand the history behind it.
 
The Belmond British Pullman is a luxury, vintage train which operates a full array of day trips and weekend breaks throughout Britain, many of them with themes such as castles, gardens, historic houses, romance and Christmas.
 
The spectacular Bernina line was completed in 1910 and is run by Rhaetian Railways. Beginning in Chur, St. Moritz or Davos, it passes the glaciers of Piz Bernina, making this the highest railway crossing in all of the Alps.
 
But strangely with each yearly iteration of Train Sim World, and the DLC that is slowly added, that dream is becoming more of a reality. Not only do you get to drive modern trains across the world, but you can also drive the old steam ones as well.
 
The new stuff on offer in Train Sim World 4 is pretty exciting too. There is the Antelope Valley line which goes across the borders of Los Angeles, taking you through the countryside, mountainsides, and deserts. Keeping on the mountain theme the next track whisks you off to Austria for the S- Bahn Vorarlberg. Lastly, but by no means least, and we head back to Blighty with the East Coast Mainline, running from Peterborough to Doncaster with over 80 miles of track. New trains and new tracks will certainly keep the train person very happy.
 
The sound design is as excellent as usual; once again with a high level of detail on how each engine sounds or the opening of a door or a certain train. There is some upbeat instrumental music in between things too, whilst a good range of voice-over actors provide useful pointers on how to begin each area.
 
Modern trains have progressed in the exact same way. For example, the new jaguar is much more refined then the XK120 was. From the basic injection moulding of the 1950s to the highly specialised mouldings with steam sound. As the technology improves so too do the model trains.
 
And there are coaches here that I designed. The Victorian Railway S-cars are scale models to 1-1000th of an inch of the real job. Everything is scale modelled. The interior inside is fitted. The magnolia on the floor of the carpet is the right colour.
 
The birthday train consists of four wagons with animals from World of Sebra and the elephant in front. The wagons can be put together as desired, and in three places on the train you can attach the included numbers from 0-9 or the three candle holders to mark the birthday boy or girl's age. The candle holders fit 1.2 cm candles, so you can use regular Danish Christmas tree candles for the train.
 
Commissioned in 1889, a gradient of up to 48 percent, about 30 minutes travel time: that is the steepest cogwheel railway in the world in figures. Meter by meter it scales the way from Alpnachstad to Pilatus Kulm, passing alpine meadows and striking rock formations.
 
Since it is almost always packed in Wonderland,
