**Caution:** Container Registry is deprecated and scheduled for shutdown. Organizations that haven't used Container Registry prior to January 8, 2024 have new gcr.io repositories hosted on Artifact Registry by default. Effective May 15, 2024, Google Cloud projects without previous usage of Container Registry will only support hosting and managing images for the gcr.io domain in Artifact Registry.
 
Artifact Analysis performs vulnerability scans on your artifacts inArtifact Registry or Container Registry (Deprecated). Artifact Analysis alsoidentifies dependencies and licenses to help you understand your softwarecomposition.
 
Artifact Analysis scans new images when they're uploaded toArtifact Registry or Container Registry. This scan extracts informationabout the packages in the container. The images are scanned only once,based on the image's digest. This means that adding or modifying tags won'ttrigger new scans.

Artifact Analysis creates occurrences for vulnerabilitiesfound when you upload the image. After the initial scan, it continuouslymonitors the metadata for scanned images in Artifact Registry andContainer Registry for new vulnerabilities.
 
Artifact Analysis receives new and updated vulnerabilityinformation from vulnerability sourcesmultiple times each day. When new vulnerability data arrives,Artifact Analysis updates the metadata of the scanned images to keep itup-to-date. Artifact Analysis updates existing vulnerability occurrences,creates new vulnerability occurrences for new notes, and deletes vulnerabilityoccurrences that are no longer valid.
 
Artifact Analysis only updates the metadata forimages that were pushed or pulled in the last 30 days.Artifact Analysis archives metadata that is older than 30 days.To re-scan an image with archived metadata, pull that image. Refreshing metadata can take up to 24 hours.
 
You can also use vulnerability scanning with manifest lists. Amanifest listis a list of pointers to manifests for several platforms. They allow a singleimage to work with multiple architectures or variations of an operating system.
 
Artifact Analysis vulnerability scanning only supports Linuxamd64 images. If your manifest list points to more than one Linux amd64 image,only the first one will be scanned; if there are no pointers to Linux amd64images, you won't get any scanning results.
 
On-demand scanning lets you scan container images locally on your computeror in your registry, using the gcloud CLI. This gives you theflexibility to customize your CI/CD pipeline, depending on when you need toaccess the vulnerability results.
 
When you push container images to Docker repositories in Artifact Registry,Artifact Analysis can scan for vulnerabilities in several types of OSpackages and application language packages. On-demand scanning can identifyvulnerabilities in a subset of these package types.
 
Artifact Analysis only scans application language packages inArtifact Registry when the packages are containerized and stored in a Dockerformat repository. The other Artifact Registryrepository formatsaren't supported.
 
You can also use theArtifact Analysis REST API toperform any of these actions. As with other Cloud Platform APIs, you mustauthenticate access usingOAuth2. After you haveauthenticated, you can use also the API to create custom notes and occurrencesand view vulnerability occurrences.
 
You can use Binary Authorization tocreate a vulnerability allowlist based on the vulnerabilityinformation provided by Artifact Analysis as part of your Cloud Buildpipeline. If the vulnerabilities violate the policy in the allowlist, the buildfails.
 
In most cases, each vulnerability is assigned a CVE ID and this IDbecomes the main identifier for that vulnerability. In cases where there is noCVE ID assigned to a vulnerability, a GHSA ID is assigned asidentifier instead. If later on that vulnerability gets a CVE ID, then thevulnerability ID is updated to match the CVE. SeeCheck for a specific vulnerability in a project for moreinformation.

Trivy scans local and remote container images, supports multiple container engines, as well as archived and extracted images. It works on raw filesystem and remote git repositories. With Trivy, you can scan whenever and wherever you need to.
 
Trend Micro Artifact Scanner (TMAS) performs pre-runtime vulnerability and malware scans on artifacts (see Supported artifacts), enabling you to identify and fix issues before they reach a production environment such as, for example, Kubernetes for container images.
 
For example, Jenkins projects can automatically build, test, and push Docker images to a Docker registry. Once pushed, the image may be instantly available to run in an orchestration environment. If open source vulnerabilities exist in the image, then they are a risk when the image is run. Since images are intended to be immutable, images should be scanned before they are deployed to a cluster.
 
TMAS scans artifacts inside your CI/CD pipelines. You can install the TMAS CLI into your CI/CD pipeline to perform scans before artifacts are deployed to production. In the case of vulnerability scans, TMAS takes the artifact that you wish to be scanned and generates a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM). It then uploads the SBOM to Trend Cloud One for processing and returns a vulnerability report.
 
Memory consumption of the TMAS CLI scales with the number of files an artifact contains. Some artifacts may require additional memory to complete successfully. Performance can be improved by increasing memory resources and CPU cores.
 
The TMAS CLI requires a valid API key to be stored in the environment variable. Add the API key associated with the Trend Cloud One region that you wish to call as an environment variable TMAS\_API\_KEY, as follows:
 
When obtaining the API key, ensure that the API key is associated with the endpoint you are calling. For instance, create an API key in a us-1 account if you are planning to call the us-1 region endpoint to ensure proper authorization.
 
For more information on available scanners and their flags, see Scan subcommands. Using a scanner-specific flag without enabling the associated scanner does not result in an error, but that flag does have no effect.
 
When switching to a different region, ensure that the TMAS\_API\_KEY, which is stored as an environment variable, is associated with that Trend Cloud One region.A mismatch causes the scan command to fail with a 403 Forbidden or APIKeyPlatformMismatchError error.
 
Using a registry as an artifact source does not require a container runtime. In addition, scan results from registry artifact sources can be used for policy evaluations in Trend Cloud One Container Security.
 
Scanning images from private registries requires that you login to the registry using tools such as docker login before attempting the scan. TMAS follows Docker's authentication behavior in order to use Docker's pre-configured credentials. When running malware scans on images from private registries and using Docker credsStore (.docker/config.json), add the credential-helpers= configuration in the .config/containers/registries.conf file. For example, if Docker credsStore is desktop, add credential-helpers = ["desktop"].
 
For version 1.35.0 and later, this tool automatically removes those temporary files after scan execution.To clean up existing temporary files that were generated with prior versions or by an interrupted scan, use the following commands (or its platform equivalent) under your discretion:
 
A given vulnerability finding is overridden if any of the rules specified in the override file apply to the finding. A rule is considered to apply to a finding only if all the fields in the rule match those found in the vulnerability finding:
 
There are many steps involved in building and deploying a containerized application, a complete container image lifecycle approach is key to managing software supply chain risks. The Lacework inline scanner allows you to integrate Lacework security capabilities deeply into your software supply chain workflows by allowing you to scan and assess Docker container images for vulnerabilities without checking them into a container registry.
 
The inline scanner container registry integration performs an inline scan outside of Lacework. You can then configure the inline scanner to send a request to Lacework to assess the collected data. After you create an inline scanner integration in the Lacework Console, you can download and deploy the inline scanner as a binary within your development tool chain.
 
The inline scanner is triggered on an on-demand basis within build chain workflows. The trigger could be, for example, the start of a new container image build in the CI pipeline or a developer wants to assess a build on their local machine. The inline scanner collects data about the container image using your configured settings about what data to collect. Using the associated server token that was created when you integrated the inline scanner in the Lacework Console, the inline scanner initiates an API request for assessment by Lacework. After the token is authorized, Lacework assesses the file data. View the results on the Vulnerability Assessment page in the Lacework Console. You can configure additional o
