Hi, I'm DarkRisingGirl & This is POKEMON Dark Rising. This is my 2nd attempt to complete a full hack with a new epic story, new characters, and a new region. I've always felt the Pokemon series needed a much stronger impact with story-telling & that's what this hack is all about. Within the hack(look to features for more information) you'll encounter pokemon from all 5 generations, the newest attacks, a brand new deep storyline evolving many characters with actual emotions compelling them to move foward, and last but not least, 2 regions with 16 badges & 1 final boss included. I thank you all for playing, I hope you enjoy! ^.^
 
You awake asking yourself questions. Deciding to ignore the dream for now, you step out into your home town known as Fells in the Core Region. Your best friend, who also had the same dream, stops you at the front door to inform you of an emergency message from the town's Professor. When you encounter the professor, he quickly informs you of the disasters and climate changes occuring all over the Core Region. His workers in panic, he asks you to visit the delivery station and pick up a package for him from Prof.Oak. As you set out on this simple task, you encounter a mysterious girl who appears to know knowledge of the dream you've had about a creature name DARUGIS. After recieving the package, a powerful pokemon is within you and your friend, Pete, sight. Eager to test your early skills against a powerful pokemon, you quickly engage in a battle with it. The pokemon uses it's powerful winds, easily defeating your pokemon and knocking you out in the process. After awakening in your room, you see Pete and your mother patiently waiting for your recovery. You soon begin to realize this is the start of a journey into many mysteries and powerful pokemon you can't wait to challenge.

world. Darugis was the highest in command and all of the legendaries respected it's power. Darugis soon felt superior, the recognization and sheer cockiness in it began to emit darkness, negativity, jealousy.

Darugis challanged Arceus but evidently lost. Arceus sent Darugis to the bowels of the darkness, locking it inside Pandora's Box. The few legendaries did not like how Arceus had banished Darugis and began to seperate. Creating their own worlds.
 
Darugis plotted, seeking revenge on Arceus. Darugis was still connected to Arceus in some way because Arceus still cared for all of it's followers. Arceus wanted to create friendship and love and thought Pokemon would be lonely.
 
Arceus felt they needed companions...Thus, the creation of humans began to soothe Arceus's worries. However, Darugis saw this as a plan. Darugis tempted the first humans, as they released it from it's imprisonment.
 
Darugis's plan was almost complete, until a young trainer named Jean Blake sealed it away inside Pandora's Box once again. But it was not sealed away completely... Extracting it's revenge, Darugis trapped Jean Blake in an endless void so he could not stop it's plans ever again.
 
The battle with the child of Jean Blake has only begun. Although Darugis lost the battle, it was far from losing the war. Spreading it's power globally, it decided to build it's throne in another Region close by. The OMNI Region. The story continues 1 month later...What will be the outcome? Only You can decide that.
 
Hello DarkRisingGirl..i want ask something..err, did you have done a complete hack version of this game? Coz' after defeating Pete, it says that the adventure continues and i can't go to the last city..if there is complete version, could you tell me the link..i love to play this game!
 
I did a quick cheat to raise my levels by five cuz it was going to happen anyway before I moved on and I wanted to move things along and my trainer name changed... is there a way to change it back so my pokemon obey me without using another cheat?
 
I am pretty far in the thing I am right now just trying to find arceus I have been damn near everywhere but can't find it! Anyone know the location of arceus? or do you have to get mew celebi deoxys and jirachi first? :frown:
