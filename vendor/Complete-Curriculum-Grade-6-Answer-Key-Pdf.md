The fifth grade is time for **fractions and decimals**, in particular. We study fractions and decimals and the operations with them in depth and with substantial detail. Students also deepen their understanding of whole numbers, learn much more problem solving, learn geometry and graphing, and get introduced to the calculator.
 
The year starts out with a study of whole numbers and their operations. Students review **multi-digit multiplication and learn long division with two-digit divisors**. We also review **divisibility and factors** from fourth grade, and study **prime factorization**.
 
The third chapter is about **equations and problem solving**. We study simple equations with the help of a pan balance. Students also do a fair amount of problem solving using the visual bar model.

The fourth chapter is about **decimals and some of the operations with decimals** (the rest will be studiedin chapter 6). Fifth grade is the time when students learn all the basic operations with decimals. In thischapter, we focus on place value with decimals, addition and subtraction of decimals, andmultiplication and division of decimals by whole numbers. Multiplying decimals by decimals anddividing decimals by decimals is covered in chapter 6.
 
In chapter 5, students **graph points and patterns in the coordinate grid, and learn about line graphs and average (mean)**.These topics tie in both with graphing in the context of algebra, and with statistical graphs.

"The most positive characteristic of the Mathematical Reasoning books are the higher order thinking skills that the content encourages. As an educator, I can appreciate that the skills involve multi-steps and hands-on manipulation."

The skills and concepts taught in our products are the result of our surveys of state and national educational standards. We will continue to avoid any topic in any set of standards that is overtly political. We firmly believe it is not our place to attempt to influence the politics or values of any student. Most Common Core Standards are already found in various state standards, but the list of Common Core Standards is not complete. Since a large number of states (45) have signed on to Common Core Standards, The Critical Thinking Co. will now include Common Core Standards in its broad survey of state and national standards to determine the skills and concepts taught in each grade level subject, but we will not base our products solely on any one set of standards. **Our products are written with longevity in mind, considering the tried and true practices of teaching children to read and think for themselves.**Those of you who have trusted us in the past can rely on us to continue to teach beyond the standards in the future. Please help us spread the word.

We started our homeschooling experience with paper/pencil curriculums and, while it started out a positive experience, it quickly got overwhelming. For all of us. The kids were overwhelmed with all the writing. I was overwhelmed with the task of teaching my kids 1-1 lessons (because they were at different levels for language arts and math) and keeping track of all the papers that needed to be printed.
