Reisalin "Ryza" Stout lives a mundane life on a farm in Rasenboden, her small, boring village on the island of Kurken. Dreaming of excitement, she and her friends head on an adventure during which they meet Empel, an alchemist. Seeing the power of alchemy firsthand, Ryza becomes determined to become an alchemist herself. This marks the start of an adventure that will lead her to save her hometown...
 
The game introduces new alchemy mechanics: Linkage Synthesis involves adding items to cells, which unlocks linked cells similarly to a Tech Tree to allow the addition of extra items and improved effects, and can even lead to completely new recipes. Rebuild allows you to re-do an item's synthesis in order to upgrade it, at the cost of raising its Dexterity requirement, limiting who can use it. With Gathering Synthesis, you can create gathering points, and share them with other players via passwords. Ryza's secret hideout can also be customized and decorated to your liking.
 
The battle system is now more action-based, with a semi-real-time Combatant Cooldown System which keeps going as you choose your next move. This time, you control only one character at a time, while your allies act automatically, though you can switch between combatants at any time. MP is gone, now replaced with Actions Points, which are gained by attacking and used to perform special moves and Quick Actions (which ignore the character's cooldown), or to raise the Tactics Level, increasing your power and maximum AP. As for items, they no longer have individual use counts, instead drawing from a shared pool of Core Charges, which can be refilled by sacrificing one item for the duration of the expedition. Fulfilling Action Orders during combat allows characters to perform special follow-up attacks when certain conditions are fulfilled.

A sequel, Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends & the Secret Fairy, was released on December 3, 2020 in Japan on the same platforms (plus the PlayStation 5), followed by a release late January 2021 for the global version and the Windows version. Notably, it stars Ryza as the main protagonist again, a first for the franchise, and is set three years after the first game. Ryza's story then concluded in Atelier Ryza 3: Alchemist of the End & the Secret Key, released worldwide on March 24, 2023.
 
An anime adaptation of the game from anime studio Liden Films was released on July 2, 2023. This makes it the second game in the entire Atelier series to be animated, following the Atelier Escha & Logy: Alchemists of the Dusk Sky anime in 2014.Atelier Ryza contains examples of the following tropes:
 
- Arbitrary Headcount Limit: Out of six eventual party members, you can only use three. Furthermore, the lineup must include one "front-line" fighters and one "rear-line". These roles are set to each character, limiting the possible party lineups. Initially the party had to have two front-liners, but this was patched out quickly.
- An Interior Designer Is You: Parts of the titular secret hideout, inside of which your atelier is located, can be customized, including the outer and inner walls, floor, rug, sofa, bed, table, and roof.
- Abusive Precursors: The Klint Kingdom government decided to deliberately introduce the Philucsa into Oren lands, betraying to Oren to allow every living thing in their lands to be Eaten Alive with the intention of harvesting the monsters for fuel. It worked too well, since when the hive was done eating the Oren they moved on to kill and eat the entire Klint Kingdom's unaware innocent citizens. It's telling that the normally kind-hearted main characters, in an Atelier game no less, show absolutely no sympathy towards the regretful Apocalyptic Log of one of those responsible for this plan shortly before he was Eaten Alive trying to divert the horde from the escaping citizens using the Holy Tower as a beacon (which still needed up as mass innocent casualties, since the towers' defenders were mostly ignorant Klint soldiers that had nothing to do with what happened with the gates. And while the kids are thankful for the construction of the artificial island the Klint Kingdom built saving their ancestors, they recognize it never should have been necessary to begin with and they would rather history had taken a different course.
- Amazon Chaser: An NPC who gets together with a girl Ryza can help during a long quest chain after watching her beat the crap out of people in martial arts tournaments on the mainland. Funnily enough, the girl in question started off the quest line looking for her prince charming but got distracted by the thrill of training and became a professional fighter, then found him after forgetting about what she originally set out to do.
- Animal Gender-Bender: One of the quests has you doing things for a goat, who Ryza consistently refers to as male and as "Mr. Goat", even though 'he' has a very, very obvious udder on account of all goats sharing the same model.
- Anti-Frustration Features:
- Every boss has an area entirely to itself, which you can easily fast-travel back to if you die while facing them to restart the fight immediately; additionally, the cutscene leading up to the boss will be shortened to just one line from Ryza.
- The Rebuild mechanic can save you a lot of frustration if you want to give your equipment a minor upgrade: instead of having to make a whole new item, you can simply pick up the synthesis where you left off and add new components to further improve its effects.
- Later in the game, you gain the ability to make duplicates of your items, which makes it a lot less frustrating to make decent equipment for your whole team.
- Aristocrats Are Evil: From Ryza's point of view, Moritz is seen as a corrupt noble figure who uses his influence to control the drinking water of Kurken Island, a sentiment that is shared by some of the residents as well. In addition, Bos and Lumbar are the classic Upper Class Twits who taunt and bully Ryza's crew on a regular basis. In the case of the latter two, though, things are a lot more complicated since this all began with Ryza and her friends ganging up on Bos to begin with as kids.
- Taken to the extreme with the alchemist ruling class of the Klint Kingdom, whose greed led to TWO genocides, one intentionally and one by accident.
- Art Evolution: Compared to past games, Atelier Ryza features more fluid animations (such as side-stepping through a narrow gap) and vastly improved lighting and shadow effects (such as Lens Flare, and a windmill whose blades cast moving shadows onto the landscape and characters). It also includes only a handful of the usual CG scenes and drops all anime cutscenes entirely in favor of showing as much of the story in-engine as possible.
- Big Damn Heroes: Early in the game, Ryza and friends are in a Hopeless Boss Fight against a monster. Empel and Lila show up just in time to take it out with an alchemic bomb.
- Bishōnen Line: The Final Boss, the Ravaging Queen, starts off as a bus-sized metallic mantis for phase 1. Phase 2 reveals a humanoid form like something out of a Toku.
- Bittersweet Ending: The Philuscha's invasion have been stopped and Kurken Island's and Underworld's water supplies have been restored, but nearly all main characters after that leave the island to chase after their own dreams. Only Ryza stays behind to help with some unresolved issues, reminiscing about the time she spend adventuring with her friends and keeping alive a vague promise of one day following after them once she truly secures the island's future. This is somewhat mitigated by the sequel since the entire premise is about them all getting together again and having another adventure in the capital.
- Call-Forward: In episode 06 of the anime, Klaudia comes to the under-construction Atelier carrying a bow, the weapon she uses in the sequels.
- Combatant Cooldown System: The battle system has combatants moving down the Visual Initiative Queue in real-time similarly to Final Fantasy's Active Time Battle, acting when they reach the end.
- Coming of Age: Ryza's first game has a recurring theme of her and her friends reaching the age at which they're becoming legal adults and finding out what they want to do in the world, frustrated with older adults also not seemingly understanding them. In the end, Ryza's friends decide to go their separate ways to pursue new careers and dreams, while Ryza chooses to stay on the Island.
- Commonplace Rare: Lampshaded in the description of the Goat Hoof Stamp you receive as part of one questline (which is categorized as a rare item in-game):"A piece of paper with a goat hoof stamped right in the middle of it. Technically speaking, this is an extremely rare item."
- Cute Slime Mook: Punis make a return in this entry and are both adorable and act as the easy beginner area mooks.
- Darker and Edgier: While it starts off as a usual lighthearted romp like the other Atelier games, there are hints early on about the game's finale including an abusive father, severe bullying, and a country committing the engineered destruction of a world and genocide of nearly an entire race of people that they pretended to befriend by deliberately introducing a invasive species of monsters with the intent to harvest said monsters organs once they had killed and eaten everything, only to have nearly all their own kingdom's people Eaten Alive as well without the public even knowing what happened amo
