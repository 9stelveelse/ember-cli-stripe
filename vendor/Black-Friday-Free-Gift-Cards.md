While those sales have come and gone, we'd say the last-minute holiday gifting season is second best for gift card deals. Right now, is a particularly great time to find promotions that offer free gift cards with your purchase of another item. You can then give that gift card as a gift, or use it to buy holiday gifts or other essentials on your shopping list.

The gift card savings are still going strong at Best Buy. Right now, you can get Best Buy gift cards for free with the purchase of a variety of other gift cards, the gift cards eligible for this deal include Delta Airlines and Apple.
 
If you're planning to do some shopping for greeting cards, gifts and more at Paper Source this holiday season, we recommend buying a $100 gift card first, so that you can take advantage of the current gift card deal. When you spend $100 on Paper Source gift cards, you'll get a $10 eGift Card.
 
My friend is an apple employee and I want to buy an ipad with the 25% employee discount. I was wondering whether I should wait for thanksgiving when there might also be some gift cards offered. Can I stack those gift cards on top of the employee discount?
 
I have called customer support twice, both claim that they resent it to me, once even saying it has been an issue with Hotmails (which I sincerely doubt). I didn't receive it either time and I honestly think its just the fact they don't want you using the gift card until the sale is over which is awful. On my apple store app it says its been delivered since Friday but I still haven't seen anything.

I have not received my card yet. I spoke to customer service who mentioned that they were having trouble with hotmail accounts. They resent them to me ... but again I did not receive them. Keep posting here to let us all know if anyone has received them. I am aware that Apple does not read these, however it is informative for us to know if people are receiving them or not.
 
I'm returning from first post on December 2nd here. After I called the second time on that date the lady told me to give a second email (I used my school email which is a gmail), I did receive the card today (December 5th) around 2:30 PM in the gmail and never had anything sent to my original hotmail. The product was ordered on Friday, November 29th and picked up the next day. So there is hope.
 
Update: I rang support and they told me the issue was on Microsoft's end (My email is Outlook). He re-sent the email and I received the gift card about 9 hours later. He did mention that if the card didn't turn up after 24 hours then call back and they would send it to a different email address.
 
I had to call 3 times before it was emailed to me. I was told they were having problems with Outlook (really???) I wonder what was really going on. Unacceptable Apple!!! It was part of the Black Friday deal to send those gift cards within 24 hours. Mine took 240 hours!!! Not even kidding!! Totally unacceptable. The second time I called I was placed on hold for 50 minutes!!! The lady that helped me the 3rd phone call was great! She emailed it to me right away.
 
How long did the sale go? I purchase it on the Dec 4th and the website still showed the sale going on but I contacted Apple and they said that it was only till Dec 2nd. I don't think I read it wrong and why would they post about a sale that was expired.
 
So I just learned my iPhone 8 order was ineligible for $50 gift card because I choose ATT as provider on checkout even while paying full price. Really frustrated as no where did it say by choosing ATT and paying full price I WOULDNT get my gift card!

The Apple Shopping Event is this year a four-day affair, that's three days more than usual. And while it's often on Thanksgiving itself, this time it'll run from Black Friday through Cyber Monday. It offers gift cards with some purchases, all at least the same value as last year's event, sometimes more.
 
So, what's available and should you buy? After all, my colleague Gordon Kelly has pointed out that Apple often limits its offers and looking elsewhere often yields better prices. Check out his rundown of it and alternative offers.
 
So, here are all the offers that have just gone live in the U.K. Apple Store. I'll be updating this post as soon as the U.S. offers go live so please check back. I fully expect offers to be on similar produ
