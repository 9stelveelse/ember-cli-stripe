The black ink won't print on our printer. We thought it was out of ink but replaced it and the black ink still won't print. It acts like its printing but it's almost like the black printing components aren't working.
 
Can somebody help? My HP photosmart C309A, after changing new ink the black big one, does not print? Some document, it can print light/grey color picture (blurred) but no text at all. I try cleaning all the advices above but none of them work! Please help, thanks
 
What they used to call 'Photo Black' is actually gray, and is used when printing color. You should try soaking the print head in warm water about 10 minutes to make sure it's clean. See if you can borrow another black cartridge to determine if your new one is defective. The Black cartridge is used to print all test reports, so when Black doesn't print, those reports print a blank page. Also, without the main Black cartridge, alignment will fail.
 
I just replaced all 5 cartridges AND the print head, and my C309a still won't print with the (main) Black cartridge. Colors and photo black all okay. So it's now a boat anchor, with > $120 new parts. I'm going to disassemble to see if I can find an interruption in the black print signals.
 
I refilled my hp61 cartridge and it would not print. I then put clear tape over the contacts and now prints fine. Please don't ask why it works with the tape on and will not if I remove it because I don't know.
 
I was having the same problem today. Ran carriage under water and dried. Still didn't work. Looked under tools menu on the printer screen and noticed "clean cartridges." Chose that option. I guess it did the job, because it ran a test print and when we tried to print again it worked just fine.
 
I just talked to HP support, they said to replace printer because print head is defective. My printer was printing blank pages I replaced all ink cartridge black, cyan, magenta and yellow, it still printed blank pages. My advice, find a better brand. HP sucks.
 
I had the same problem, the printer made all the manoeuvers and sounds as if printing, but the page came out blank! I have all the inks (bought and replaced those that were half empty), to no avail. I had the print heads cleaned several times, following the instructions, no results either. The best solution is to buy another printer.
 
I had the same issue with the black cartridge not printing, but the colors printed, This procedure worked: remove the "bad" cartridge and clean the round filter with a facial cleaning cotton pad (or Qtip) dipped in rubbing alcohol. Let is set on the filter for a few minutes to soften the gunk, then gently rub the round filter several times to clear it. Then, reinsert the cartridge back into the printer. Then open the front display, swipe to find the setup link, scroll down to printer maintenance, select it, scroll down to "clean print heads". I had to run it 3 times (each time it ran, it gave a report to see how it was cleaning and I flipped the test paper over to save sheets). It worked great! I would not use water from the tap as takes too long to dry, plus water and electronics don't do well together. I have the HP Office Jet Pro 6830 e All in One.
 
HP printers seem so affordable on purchase but have such annoying issues after and way too much time spent on solutions! Mine will not allow me to print full page photos only smaller ones. No solution has helped.
 
HP has added some type of sensor to their printer so that one is unable to use refilled cartridges. I have refilled ink cartridges for years with no problems. HP wants you to spend more money by making it so that their printer only works with a brand new original cartridge. My suggestion, never buy another HP printer unless you want to spend hundreds of dollar more on ink!
 
It's really odd, but putting a clear tape over the contacts of the black ink cartridge (and left it there) worked! The printer (HP DeskJet Ink Advantage 1115) now prints the "missing black ink" needed. Perhaps I'll just remove the clear tape next time.
 
I figured out for it to accept the Color cartridge I have to Reset the printer (instruction for HP deskjet reset is available on internet), however, it never accepted black cartridge, it always show Black cartridge Indicator LED blinking meaning it is not recognizing the refilled cartridge. So after reading everyone post above, I also just applied clear masking tape on the complete contact points of the black cartridge and then inserted it. The printer still says it has not detected the black cartridge (because the LED light for black cartridge is constantly on). However, when I print I can see black ink is getting printed. I have a doubt whether this is actually blank ink or color ink is printing black color. i suspect it is later, I will post update in future.
 
I'm using windows 10, 64 bit and my Officejet 4620 printer wouldn't print black despite having a new HP cartridge. I removed the printer, uninstalled the software and set up the printer again from scratch. It now works.
 
I tried that as well--Cleaned printhead manually, new cartridges, MULTIPLE new cartridges! uninstalled/reinstalled software. Colors are fine it is JUST the black ink. Arrrggggh! I cannot find a "clean cartridges" anywhere.
 
I have had this happen twice with my HP Deskjet 3510. I got on HP phone support and went through all the steps & tips both times and nothing helped. Finally, they suggested I try ANOTHER new black ink cartridge, and it worked perfectly. Apparently, the initial ink cartridges were defective. HP sent me a new cartridge and I mailed the defective one back to them.
 
2) take out the black ink cartridge and use a small stiff paint brush and brush the printer head ( looks like a little round mesh metal screen) I went back-and-forth and in a circular motion several times and then replaced the ink cartridge. A little dab of rubbing alcohol may help.
 
Solution 2 - I own an HP Office Jet Pro 6830e All in One. I used a facial cotton pad dipped in rubbing alcohol, then let it set on the mesh filter for a few minutes to soften the gunk before gently rubbing the filter. Place the cartridge back in the slot, close the lid. Then, on the front display swipe it to find the setup link, then scroll down to the printer maintenance link, then scroll down to the "clean print heads". I ran the procedure 3 times (each one printed a test sheet), flipped the test sheet over in the tray to use the reverse clean side (saving paper), and it WORKED. I would not use water to clean the round mesh head as water and electronics don't mix. Thank goodness I am back in business!
 
HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 5525. I have bought original cartidges. The black one was identified by the printer as counterfeit for some reason. I replaced it with another original. The printer stopped printing black ink. The diagnostic page shows the box where the black was supposed to be as white. I have tried all the options to clean the printer. no result. This is the second printer in two years that has the same issue.
 
I AM DONE with this company. This is scandalous. It is obvious that this is a firmware/software issue that blocks the printer from using the black ink. I will never buy HP for personnal use, or for my business ever again, and I urge everyone to do the same. Enough is enough.
 
Yes this fixed mine after going through all the other ideas at least twice . I did not know about the vent. In fact after sticking the pin in the hole the black came through partially. Then examining the vent again I discovered the plastic covering the label was partially covering the end of the vent channel. When I pulled it away and cut if off the channel was exposed and the ink printed perfectly.
 
The problem is related to a clog you can't easily get rid of without physically removing the printhead and soaking it in hot water. I fixed this on a removable printhead model and it printed perfectly after I cleaned the head this way.
 
While my guide covers the cleaning process, it doesn't cover the required disassembly to remove the printhead on permanently installed printers. I don't have one of these, so I can't repeat the procedure on a printer with a similarly mounted printhead like you have. It's also highly unlikely I'll ever do it unless I get the printer for free and the owner doesn't want it back. **You don't want to get water in the flatflex connectors, so only use a small amount of water. This is potentially deadly, as some of these printers are known to demand SETUP ink the owners probably no longer have.**
 
Followed everything. I am getting the notification that the ink carriage cannot move. It does make a bang insid
