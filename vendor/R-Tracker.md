The Kiel Institute uses allocations as our main measure, rather than promised support (commitments). We had introduced the shift to allocations in February, based on a new research note. Please download here the updated note, with definitions and explanations of new trends, including our explanation of the new US April aid bill for Ukraine.
 
A long-awaited Ukraine supplemental appropriations bill for Ukraine was finally signed into law on April 24, after months of deliberation. At USD 31.5 billion, the funds destined for Ukraine are only about half of the reported USD 61 billion and are significantly lower than the USD 39.5 billion granted in December 2022. The other half is mostly Department of Defense funding for procurement, operations, and maintenance and is not directly attributable as aid for Ukraine. There is still a large discrepancy between air defense equipment provided to Ukraine and the stocks held by the donor states. This is shown in the latest update of the Ukraine Support Tracker, which tracks aid to Ukraine through April 30, 2024.
 
A main aim of this database to quantify the scale of aid to Ukraine and to make the support measures comparable across donor countries. Much of the discussion on aid to Ukraine since the beginning of the war has been anecdotal, while a rigorous quantification has been missing. Our aim is to quantify the**support flows by Western governments to Ukraine** in millions of Euros, accounting for both financial and in-kind transfers. To do so, we set up a comprehensive database that brings together information from official, government sources, existing lists of Ukraine aid, and reports by renowned news media.
 
The Ukraine Support Tracker lists and quantifies military, financial, and humanitarian aid pledged to Ukraine since January 24, 2022. It covers 41 countries, specifically the EU member states, other members of the G7, as well as Australia, South Korea, Turkey, Norway, New Zealand, Switzerland, China, Taiwan, India and Iceland. Also, EU institutions are included as a separate donor. The tracker lists government-to-government support; private donations or those from international organizations such as the IMF are not included in the main database. Flows going into other countries like, for example, Moldova, are not included. The database **does not include other types of support**, in particular donations by private individuals, companies, churches, or non-governmental organizations. We have also not (yet) systematically collected support by international organizations like the Red Cross or the United Nations, mainly because a lack of systematic data and reporting by most such international organizations.

The team is continuing research into the impacts and determinants of pandemic policy and working with partners to devise new approaches to data collection that can be deployed quickly in the face of future pandemics or global emergencies.
 
The OxCGRT dataset was collected by a team of over 1500 volunteers and published in real-time to understand variations in government responses and the effects of different policies on the pandemic and other outcomes of interest.
 
By May 2023, most countries have lifted their COVID-19-related policies and the WHO declared an end to the public health emergency of international concern. The OxCGRT project, therefore, shifted its primary focus from collecting and reviewing data on government responses to the pandemic to carrying out cutting-edge research using the indicators we created in the past three years and providing decision-makers with evidence-based policy recommendations on the most effective responses in fighting future pandemics and epidemics. Our efforts are now directed at identifying the most pressing research questions on pandemic responses as well as answering these questions through rigorous scientific analysis.
 
Although a substantial body of scientific research on COVID-19 government responses has already been published, many research questions remain unanswered. Current empirical evidence strongly supports the view that stronger and more timely government responses were crucial in curbing the spread of the virus, yet a lack of consensus prevails on many other issues. The OxCGRT has identified numerous significant avenues for future research. So, in the next years, our researchers will analyse our authoritative dataset with innovative quantitative and qualitative methods to delve deeper into different government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and shed light on the causal links between pandemic responses and relevant social, political, and economic factors. By answering these questions, the OxCGRT project will continue to play a key role in building a safer, healthier, and more prosperous world that is better prepared for the next global virus.
 
The OxCGRT Seminar Series aims to provide an platform for scholars working on COVID-19 responses, offering an opportunity to present and discuss their ongoing research work as well as to connect with the broader research community.
 
The OxCGRT has created an authoritative global dataset of COVID-19 policy responses. The dataset reports three years of policy settings for over 180 countries and over 200 subnational jurisdictions, covering 23 policy indicators, such as school closures, travel restrictions, mask mandates, and vaccination policies. The indicators are also aggregated into a suite of policy indices. Since its launch, the tracker has become a key global resource used by policymakers worldwide and cited in thousands of COVID-19 research studies.
 
The OxCGRT dataset was created by more than 1500 citizen scientists all around the world who volunteered their time to search for, interpret, and record policy actions during an unprecedented crisis. The resulting dataset was only possible because of the hard work of this global team of data collectors.
 
Data was collected from public sources by a team of more than 1700 university students, staff and volunteers from every part of the world. Contributing team:
