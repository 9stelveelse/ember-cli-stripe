Arising alongside video game development in the 1980s, the term *gameplay* was used solely within the context of video games, though now its popularity has begun to see use in the description of other, more traditional, game forms. Generally, gameplay is considered the overall experience of playing a video game, excluding factors like graphics and sound. Game mechanics, on the other hand, is the sets of rules in a game that are intended to produce an enjoyable gaming experience. Academic discussions tend to favor *game mechanics* specifically to avoid *gameplay* since the latter is too vague.[13] The word is sometimes misapplied to card games where, however, the usual term is "play" and refers to the way the cards are played out in accordance with the rules (as opposed to other aspects such as dealing or bidding).
 
There are three components to gameplay: "Manipulation rules", defining what the player can do in the game, "Goal Rules", defining the goal of the game, and "Metarules", defining how a game can be tuned or modified.[14] In video games gameplay can be divided into several types. For example, *cooperative gameplay* involves two or more players playing on a team. Another example is *twitch gameplay* which is based around testing a player's reaction times and precision, maybe in rhythm games or first-person shooters.[*citation needed*] Various gameplay types are listed below.
 
Playability is the ease by which the game can be played or the quantity or duration that a game can be played and is a common measure of the quality of gameplay.[20] Playability evaluative methods target games to improve design while player experience evaluative methods target players to improve gaming."[19] This is not to be confused with the ability to control (or play) characters in multi-character games such as role playing games or fighting games, or factions in real-time strategy games.
 
Playability is defined as a set of properties that describe the Player Experience using a specific game system whose main objective is to provide enjoyment and entertainment by being credible and satisfying when the player plays alone or in the company of others. Playability is characterized by different attributes and properties to measure the video game player experience.[21]

The playability analysis is a very complex process due to the different point of view to analyze the different part of video game architecture. Each facet allows us to identify the different playability's attributes and properties affected by the different elements of video game architecture.[22] The playability's facets are:
 
Finally, a video game's "global" playability will be deduced through each attribute value in the different playability's facets. It is crucial to improve the playability in the different facets to guarantee the best player experience when the player plays the video game.
 
While EA doesn't have much competition outside of its walls, the presence of two football games that are somewhat intertwined but have different teams of men and women working on them (there is some crossover) feels as if there is some healthy competition in the building, which appears to be good for both products.
 
I will explore each aspect of Madden, from modes to presentation. However, in this article, I will focus on two of the primary aspects of my LIT concept (Looks, Immersion, Touch): the visuals and gameplay.
 
At this point, anyone expecting EA to completely change their gameplay approach on a formula that mainly works well and has been enormously successful isn't living in reality. Those people are also likely robbing themselves of some enjoyable games of video game football.
 
There is a repeated focus on physics-based tackling. Does Madden 25 deliver the perfect balance between the complete ragdoll physics we saw in Backbreaker and the more football-conscious, contextually aware All-Pro Football 2K8?
 
Successful gameplay actions on both sides of the ball can be satisfying. The two new features that I could feel the most were the new ball-carrier moves and Boom Tech, which mostly touches gameplay on the defensive side of the ball.
 
It is a perfect year for San Francisco 49ers star Christian McCaffrey to be on the cover of Madden. EA has given tons of attention to increasing the functionality of what users can do while controlling ball carriers.
 
Perhaps the best part about this enhancement is that it isn't accessible to every running back, quarterback, wide receiver, or tight end in the game. The juke, spin, agility, and related attributes determine how deep the player's bag is in this regard.
 
The Boom Tech concept is a broad term referring to the tech EA used to upgrade multiple areas of gameplay. For me, it felt most impactful on defense, especially with the changes to the Hit Stick mechanic.
 
The revamped Hit Stick offers various results based on timing, momentum, weight, speed, strength, and player ratings to determine the animations and results of all tackles, but this is especially important for Hit Stick attempts.
 
I had one Hit Stick with the Chicago Bears' Tremaine Edmonds that would qualify as a perfect execution. It resulted in a fumble on the sidelines by the Detroit Lions' Jahmyr Gibbs. The fumble triggered another aspect of improved gameplay, as the recovery system has improved.
 
We're still not at the point where we have as much control over whether we can fall on it or attempt to scoop and go, but it looks and feels more natural and realistic. The only way EA will ever completely conquer this, and a few other trench-related issues are to figure out a pile-up system that allows bodies to stack on top of each other during gameplay.
 
Trench play from an offensive line standpoint feels much better. The increased pocket logic encourages you to play more like an NFL quarterback. Stepping up in the pocket feels more contextual and better associated with your O-Line's ability to create a safe space for the QB to operate.
 
EA had yet to give the Bears' line much respect in the build I played, so No. 1 overall pick Caleb Williams wasn't getting much time to throw the ball. On the downs, when he did have time, I had to train myself to step up to create different angles and windows to pass.
 
I touched on the run game with the ball-carrier liberation, but the improvement on this side rightfully goes back to the O-Line play. I found that EA continues to make strides with AI for offensive linemen. There are 500 new animations in the game for blocking alone, per EA.
 
Users have even more options to direct their offensive line before the snap to nullify defenders. In more ways than before, your success will be based on your pre-snap recognition, one of the most enormous skill-gap dividers in Madden and the real-life NFL.
 
On the defensive side of the ball, we saw similar work go into the coverage shell integrity that I noticed in College Football 25. Even more than in College Football, quarterbacks aren't going to get away with putting the ball up into spaces and hoping for the best.
 
The core principles of doing your job individually on defense and being where you should be on the field felt solid. In replays and a couple of CPU-vs-CPU games, the AI-controlled players play with a decent balance of attribute recognition and logical, real-world football behavior.
 
The young man is unbelievably good at Madden and has a high football IQ in general. It was impressive to listen to him explain why he just read, reacted, and destroyed everything you were trying to do in the passing game.
 
The playbooks are unbelievably deep, and EA is still committed to adding new plays during the season based on the strategies they see from NFL coaches. As was the case in Madden 24, the team and playbook you choose are very important, and learning the style of play that best fits you as a user is equally essential.
 
Wrapping the positives, I loved seeing the new NFL kickoff rules in the game. It's the first time we've seen this in action, and it felt completely different. It will be interesting to see how real NFL coaches attempt to scheme for success in this area of the game and how EA reacts to those real-world changes.
 
On the downside, I'd still like to see more sideline awareness for receivers and running backs coming out of the backfield on wheel routes. For years, players in Madden have allowed passes to pull them out of bounds if they're running their route near the sidelines.
 
The toe-tap animations have addressed this on some level over the past few years. However, it is still frustrating sometimes to see a guy run out of bounds without regard to where he is on the field and without an animation that suggests he's aware he can't catch the ball on the wrong side of the boundary.
 
Another negative is the absence of College Football 25's Wear-and-Tear system. Both games have an exclusive gameplay concept. Madden got BOOM Tech, and College Football has the WAT system. WAT is more impactful, and you can easily argue that it belongs in both games because it relates to football at all levels.
 
It felt very similar to switching your defensive control before the snap; only it happens when the ball is live. Color me lukewarm on this one, as it could be a skill issue, but how many players will benefit from this new mechanic?
 
The last thing I didn't like was the
