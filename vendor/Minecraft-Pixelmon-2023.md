Where can I go in the world to find weaker, lower-level challenges for my starter to grow and fight against? Or am I stuck praying to find a low-level pokemon without accidentally running into a level 45?

You cant can't necessarily find weak pixelmon in a certain area, because the pixelmon that live and spawn in said area have randomly generated levels according to their current evolution stage and which pixelmon they are themselves. (Example: If a Weedle spawns In a plains biome, its level will be randomly picked from in-between 2-12)
 
Pixelmon Mod (1.20.2, 1.16.5) (or Pixelmon Reforged) is the perfect mod for all Minecraft players that are fans of the popular game Pokmon. This mod adds nearly 905 of the cute critters to the game. It is fully configurable and has a lot of cool features like a functioning pokedex, a 3D pokeball and capture animation, a fossil machine for reviving fossils found around the world and much, much more! Pixelmon Mod also have a comprehensive attack system featuring over 500 attacks, including status effects and stats modifiers. While many mods which add content to the game are known to interfere with other mods functioning correctly, this mod makes no change to any base files, which means it works well with the vast majority of other mods and can be used right alongside some of the most popular Minecraft add-ons available today.
 
Pixelmon is a mod that returns to the fray with a large increase in the number of species of Pokemon that will be added to the generation of your worlds of Minecraft. Currently you will be able to find up to 510+ pokemons. Incredible. It is the perfect mod for Minecraft if players really want to change their gameplay experience. This is no resource pack offering a facelift and standard Minecraft besides: this is like a whole new game. There is a complete features list below following screenshots.

I'm able to run a server with the Pixelmon mod in the way they instruct, ie. using the forge launcher. I'd like to write a side mod for Pixelmon and am attempting to run the forge server in Eclipse. The server and client run fine with my own mod or no additional mods aside from the ones packaged for modding with forge, but it crashes when I put the pixelmon jar in the mods folder (see trace below).
 
The problem with option 4 here, is that while I know it's possible I can't (and haven't been able to for some time) find the necessary instructions. The things I can find now, posted by people who would know how to do 4 are suggesting doing 3.
