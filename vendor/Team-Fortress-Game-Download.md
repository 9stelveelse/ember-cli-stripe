*Team Fortress 2* has received critical acclaim for its art direction, gameplay, humor, and use of character in a wholly multiplayer game,[4][5][6][7] and since its release has been referred to as one of the greatest video games ever created.[8][9][10] The game continues to receive official Valve server support as of January 2024,[11] in addition to new content being released on a seasonal basis in the form of submissions made through the Steam Workshop. In June 2011, the game became free-to-play, with revenue derived from microtransactions for in-game cosmetics. A 'drop system' was also added and refined, allowing free-to-play users to periodically receive in-game equipment and items. Though the game has had an unofficial competitive scene since its release, both support for official competitive play through ranked matchmaking and an overhauled casual experience were added in July 2016.[12] Since early 2020, the official Valve servers have seen an influx of bot accounts using cheat software, often inhibiting legitimate gameplay, which led to multiple online protests to call for actions against the bots and their hosts.[13]
 
In most game modes, two teams, RED and BLU, compete for a combat-based objective.[5] Players can choose to play as one of nine character classes in these teams, each with their own unique strengths, weaknesses, and weapon sets. In order to accomplish objectives efficiently, a balance of these classes is required due to how these strengths and weaknesses interact with each other in a team-based environment. Although the abilities of a number of classes have changed from earlier *Team Fortress* incarnations, the basic elements of each class have remained, them being one primary weapon, one secondary weapon, and one melee weapon.[14][15] The game was released with six official maps, although over one hundred maps have since been included in subsequent updates, including community-created maps.[16][17] When players choose a gamemode for the first time, an introductory video is played, showing how to complete its objectives. During matches, the Administrator,[18] voiced by Ellen McLain, announces the teams' current objectives over loudspeakers.[19] The player limit for one match is 16 on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, and 24 on the Windows edition.[20] However, in 2008, the Windows edition was updated to include a server variable that allows for up to 32 players.[21] Furthermore, in 2023, the Windows edition was updated to have unrestricted player counts for up to 100 players in a single server.[22]

*Team Fortress 2* is the first of Valve's multiplayer games to provide detailed statistics for individual players, such as the total amount of time spent playing as each class, most points obtained, and most objectives completed in a single life. Persistent statistics tell the player how they are performing in relation to these statistics, such as if a player comes close to their record for the damage inflicted in a round.[16] *Team Fortress 2* also features numerous achievements for carrying out certain tasks, such as achieving a certain number of kills or completing a specific objective. Sets of class-specific achievements have been added in updates, which can award weapons to the player upon completion. This unlockable system has since been expanded into a random drop system, with which players can also obtain items simply by playing the game.[23]
 
*Team Fortress 2* is played competitively, through multiple leagues. The North American league, ESEA, supports a paid *Team Fortress 2* league, with $42,000 in prizes for the top teams in 2017.[44][45][46] While formalized competitive gameplay is very different from normal *Team Fortress 2*, it offers an environment with a much higher level of teamwork than in public servers. Most teams use voice chat to communicate, and use a combination of strategy, communication, and mechanical skill to win against other teams. Community-run competitive leagues also tend to feature restrictions such as item bans and class limits. These leagues are often supported by Valve via in-game medals (which are submitted via the Steam Workshop) and announcements on the official blog.[47][48][49]
 
In April 2015, Valve announced that a dedicated competitive mode would be added to *Team Fortress 2*, utilizing skill-based matchmaking;[50] closed beta testing began in the following year.[51] The competitive mode was added in the "Meet Your Match" update, released on July 7, 2016.[52] Ranked matches are played six-vs-six, with players ranked in thirteen tiers based on win/losses and an assessment of their skills.[53] Ranked matchmaking will balance players based on their tiers and rating. A similar matchmaking approach has been added for casual games for matches of 12-vs-12 players. In order to join competitive matchmaking, players must have associated their Steam account with the Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator, as well as having a *Team Fortress 2* "premium account", which is unlocked by either having bought the game before it went free-to-play or by having made an in-game item purchase since.[54]
 
*Team Fortress 2* is played in a variety of different formats, which dictate the maximum size and composition of a team and can drastically change the impact of a single player's gameplay or choice of class. The two most basic formats consist of 12v12 and 6v6 ("Sixes"), the two being used on official Valve servers for casual and competitive modes respectively with no additional limitations. Most competitive leagues host Sixes but include limits on certain classes and weapons to preserve traditional, skill-based playstyles, for example limiting the allowed amount of Medics or Demomen to one on either team or banning certain movement-enhancing weapons from use. Other popular formats include "Highlander", a 9v9 format with a limit of one player per each of the nine classes, as well as a Sixes-inspired 7v7 variant thereof known as "Prolander" to allow for strategically switching classes during a competitive game.[47][48][55]
 
*Team Fortress 2* features nine playable classes, which are evenly split and categorized into "Offense", "Defense", and "Support".[16] Each class has strengths and weaknesses and must work with other classes to be efficient, encouraging strategy and teamwork.[56] Each class has at least three default weapons: a primary weapon, secondary weapon, and melee weapon. Engineers have two additional slots for their PDAs, and Spies have an additional slot for their disguise kit. An additional character, Saxton Hale, is playable in the "Versus Saxton Hale" game mode.[57]
 
Although *Team Fortress 2* is designed as an open-ended multiplayer experience without an active storyline, the game and additional material feature a wider narrative centered around Mann Co. The main PvP gamemodes are set during the "Gravel Wars", a conflict between the rival heirs Redmond and Blutarch Mann for which the nine playable characters were hired as mercenaries. Gray Mann later emerges as the third competitor, killing his two brothers and forcing Saxton Hale to rehire the mercenaries to protect Mann Co. from Gray's robot army in the Mann vs Machine cooperative horde-shooter mode.

The original *Team Fortress* was developed by the Australian team TF Software, comprising Robin Walker and John Cook,[*citation needed*] as a free mod for the 1996 PC game *Quake*.[73] In 1998, Walker and Cook were employed by Valve, which had just released its first game, *Half-Life.* Valve began developing *Team Fortress 2* as an expansion pack for *Half-Life* using Valve's GoldSrc engine, and gave a release date for the end of the year.[73] In 1999, Valve released *Team Fortress Classic,* a port of the original *Team Fortress,* as a free *Half-Life* mod.[74] *Team Fortress Classic* was developed using the publicly available *Half-Life* software development kit as an example to the community and industry of its flexibility.[75]
 
Unlike *Team Fortress,* Valve originally planned *Team Fortress 2* to have a modern war aesthetic. It would feature innovations including a command hierarchy with a Commander class, parachute drops over enemy territory, and networked voice communication.[76] The Commander class played similarly to a real-time strategy game, with the player viewing the game from a bird's-eye perspective and issuing orders to players and AI-controlled soldiers.[76]
 
*Team Fortress 2* was first shown at E3 1999[77] as *Team Fortress 2: Brotherhood of Arms*, where Valve showcased new technologies including parametric animation, which blended animations for smoother, more lifelike movement,[78] and Intel's multi-resolution mesh technology, which dynamically reduced the detail of distant on-screen elements to improve performance.[78] The game earned several awards including Best Online Game and Best Action Game.[77]
 
In mid-2000, Valve announced that *Team Fortress 2* had been delayed for a second time.[79] They attributed the delay to development switching to its new in-house engine, Source. Following the announcement, Valve released no news on the game for six years.[80] Walker and Cook worked on various other Valve projects; Walker was project lead on *Half-Life 2: Episode One*[81] and Cook worked on Valve's content distribution platform, Steam.[82] *Team Fortress 2* became a prominent example of vaporware, a long-anticipated game that had seen years of development, and was often mentioned alongside another much-delayed game, *Duke Nukem Forever.*[83] Walker said that Valve built three or four different versions of *Team Fortress 2* before settling on their final design.[84] Shortly before the release of *Half-Life 2* in 2004, Valve's marketing director, Doug Lombardi, confirmed that *Team Fortress 2* was still in development*.*[14]
