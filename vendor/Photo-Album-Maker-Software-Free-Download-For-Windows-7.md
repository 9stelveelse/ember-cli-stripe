I have Affinity Photo and Designer and want to make a photo album to be printed out. I will obviously use Affinity Photo to doctor the pictures but which shall I use to construct the album with multiple photos and text?
 
I would like to start from PhotoShop templates (for cover and inside pages) that are provided by company that will print that photo album. I can open them in Affinity. Finally I should provide each double-page as separate jpg file.
 
Thank you for quick response. Releally good video to start making photo album/book.
Are there any other tutorials supporting making photo book/album in Affinity Photo (e.g. basic typography, working with frames and effects good for album)?
 
How to reset image to oryginal aspect ratio (something like image size properties under right mouse click)?
Is it possible to set required dimensions in mm for the image and move image inside such a window?
 
The **Transform** panel allows you to set the size and the position by typing a value in the boxes. You can type something like 100 mm for millimetres, even if the box is displaying in pixels (px).
 
My document is the cover of photo album. I placed image and I want this image to be background for the front side of the cover.
How to do that? I don't want to use image handles because it changes aspect ratio.
I tried to use crop tool but I cant (or don't know how) apply it selectively to image but it works only for entire document.
How to do that like in primitive on-line programs for making photo albums?
I am looking for functionality to set required size of the image (let's call it "window for image") then to be able to set position of the image inside such window or to zoom in/out image inside such window.
I hope that I explained what am looking for. Is it possible in Affinity?
